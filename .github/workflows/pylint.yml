# Always run on Pull Requests as then this check can be marked as required.  It takes less than
# two minutes to run and we can probably decrease this over time.

# This check runs on PRs using a defined pylint version (from utils/cq/requirements.txt) but on
# landings using the latest version.  Landings builds also trigger a check to see if
# a newer version is available.
