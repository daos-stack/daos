name: clang-format

# Report style formatting changes.
# Run git-clang-format on the contents of the PR against the target commit and display a diff of
# any recommended changes.  Fail the job if any are recommended.
#
# Future work would be to have a way to apply these automatically which would require making and
# pushing a new git commit so should be optional.
#
# Runs in a fedora docker container to get a recent clang-format version.
#
# This checks out the tree with the default settings - a merge commit of the PR with the target
# branch, then it applies git-clang-format which only works against branches, not where branches
# diverge, and then it removes any changes to auto-generated files.  The result should be something
# that can be applied to the PR however it may not apply cleanly if there are merge issues with
# master - although in this case the PR should be merged with the target before landing in any case.
