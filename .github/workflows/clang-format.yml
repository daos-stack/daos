name: clang-format

# Report style formatting changes.
# Run git-clang-format on the contents of the PR against the target commit and display a diff of
# any recommended changes.  Fail the job if any are recommended.
#
# Future work would be to have a way to apply these automatically which would require making and
# pushing a new git commit so should be optional.
#
# Runs in a fedora docker container to get a recent clang-format version.
