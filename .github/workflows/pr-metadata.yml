  # Having this be pull_request_target rather than pull_request means it runs in the context of the
  # target branch rather than the PR, which in turn means the checkout is of the target.
  # Trigger for the defaults plus "edited" so that it re-runs if a PR title is modified as that's
  # what it's checking.  This probably doesn't need to run on synchronize however if a PR is being
  # worked then re-checking the Jira metadata is no bad thing.
