## What is DAOS?

The **D**istributed **A**synchronous **O**bject **S**torage (DAOS) is an
open-source software-defined object store designed from the ground up for
massively distributed Non Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage of next
generation NVM technology like Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVM express (NVMe)
while presenting a key-value storage interface and providing features such as
transactional non-blocking I/O, advanced data protection with self-healing on
top of commodity hardware, end-to-end data integrity, fine-grained data control
and elastic storage to optimize performance and cost.

DAOS supports multiple application interfaces including a parallel filesystem,
Hadoop/Spark connector, TensorFlow-IO, native Python dictionary bindings, HDF5,
MPI-IO and more to come.
