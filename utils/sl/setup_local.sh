# This script sets up the PATH environment variable after a local
# coral build.   It uses the .build_vars*.sh script generated by a build
# to setup bin directories for the built component and its prerequisites.
# The generated script sets SL_[prereq]_PREFIX for all prerequisites and
# SL_PREFIX for the component itself.  Additionally, it exports unique
# SL_*PREFIX variables to be used by component specific wrapper scripts
# to setup things like PYTHONPATH, CPATH, LIBRARY_PATH, as needed.
