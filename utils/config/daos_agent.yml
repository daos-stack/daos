# DAOS agent configuration file.
#
# Location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the
# path specified through the -o option of the daos_agent command line.
# Otherwise, /etc/daos/daos_agent.yml is used.
#
# Section describing the daos_agent configuration
#
# Although not supported for now, one might want to connect to multiple
# DAOS installations from the same node in the future.
#
# Specify the associated DAOS systems.
# Name must match name specified in the daos_server.yml file on the server.
#
# NOTE: changing the name is not supported yet, it must be daos_server
#
# default: daos_server
#name: daos_server

# Management server access points
# Must have the same value for all agents and servers in a system.
# default: hostname of this node
#access_points: ['hostname1']

# Force different port number to connect to access points.
# default: 10001
#port: 10001

## Transport Credentials Specifying certificates to secure communications
#
#transport_config:
#  # In order to disable transport security, uncomment and set allow_insecure
#  # to true. Not recommended for production configurations.
#  allow_insecure: false
#
#  # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs
#  ca_cert: /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt
#  # Agent certificate for use in TLS handshakes
#  cert: /etc/daos/certs/agent.crt
#  # Key portion of Agent Certificate
#  key: /etc/daos/certs/agent.key

# Use the given directory for creating unix domain sockets
#
# NOTE: Do not change this when running under systemd control. If it needs to
#       be changed, then make sure that it matches the RuntimeDirectory setting
#       in /usr/lib/systemd/system/daos_agent.service
#
# default: /var/run/daos_agent
#runtime_dir: /var/run/daos_agent

# Full path and name of the DAOS agent logfile.
# default: /tmp/daos_agent.log
#log_file: /tmp/daos_agent.log

## Force specific debug mask for daos_agent (control plane).
## Mask specifies minimum level of message significance to pass to logger.
## Currently supported values are DISABLED, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE and ERROR.
#
## default: INFO
#control_log_mask: DEBUG

## Disable automatic eviction of open pool handles on agent shutdown. By default,
## the agent will evict all open pool handles for local processes on shutdown.
## Note that this implies that stopping or restarting the agent will result
## in interruption of DAOS I/O for any local DAOS client processes that have
## an open pool handle.
# disable_auto_evict: true

## Disable the agent's internal caches. If set to true, the agent will query the
## server access point and local hardware data every time a client requests
## rank connection information.
#
## default: false
#disable_caching: true

## Automatically expire the agent's remote cache after a period of time defined in
## minutes. It will refresh the data the next time it is requested.
#
## default: 0 (never expires)
#cache_expiration: 30

## Ignore a subset of fabric interfaces when selecting an interface for client
## applications.
#
#exclude_fabric_ifaces: ["lo", "eth1"]

# Manually define the fabric interfaces and domains to be used by the agent,
# organized by NUMA node.
# If not defined, the agent will automatically detect all fabric interfaces and
# select appropriate ones based on the server preferences.
