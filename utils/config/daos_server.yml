## DAOS server configuration file.
#
## Location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the
## path specified through the -f option of the daos_server command line.
## Otherwise, /etc/daos_server.conf is used.
#
#
## Name associated with the DAOS system.
## Immutable after reformat.
#
#name: daos
#
#
## Access points
#
## To operate, DAOS will need a quorum of access point nodes to be available.
## Must have the same value for all agents and servers in a system.
## Immutable after reformat.
## Hosts can be specified with or without port, default port below
## assumed if not specified.
#
## default: hostname of this node at port 10001 for local testing
#access_points: ['hostname1:10001']
#
#
## Force default port
#
## Force different port number to bind daos_server to, this will also
## be used when connecting to access points if no port is specified.
#
## default: 10001
#port: 10001
#
## Transport Credentials Specifying certificates to secure communications
#
#transport_config:
#  # Specify to bypass loading certificates and use insecure communications channnels
#  allow_insecure: false
#  # Location where daos_server will look for Client certificates
#  client_cert_dir: .daos/clients
#  # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs
#  ca_cert: .daos/daosCA.crt
#  # Server certificate for use in TLS handshakes
#  cert: .daos/daos_server.crt
#  # Key portion of Server Certificate
#  key: .daos/daos_server.key
#
#
## Fault domain path
#
## Immutable after reformat.
#
## default: /hostname for a local configuration w/o fault domain
#fault_path: /vcdu0/rack1/hostname
#
#
## Fault domain callback
#
## Path to executable which will return fault domain string.
## Immutable after reformat.
#
#fault_cb: ./.daos/fd_callback
#
#
## Use specific OFI interfaces
#
## Specify either a single fabric interface that will be used by all
## spawned servers or a comma-seperated list of fabric interfaces to be
## assigned individually.
## By default, the DAOS server will auto-detect and use all fabric
## interfaces if any and fall back to socket on the first eth card
## otherwise.
#
#fabric_ifaces: [qib0,qib1]
#
#
## Use specific OFI provider
#
## Force a specific provider to be used by all the servers.
## The default provider depends on the interfaces that will be auto-detected:
## ofi+psm2 for Omni-Path, ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm for Infiniband/RoCE and finally
## ofi+socket for non-RDMA-capable Ethernet.
#
#provider: ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm
#
#
## Storage mount directory
#
## TODO: If no pre-configured mountpoints are specified, DAOS will auto-detect
## NVDIMMs, configure them in interleave mode, format with ext4 and
## mount with the DAX extension creating a subdirectory within scm_mount_path.
#
## This option allows to specify a preferred path where the mountpoints will
## be created. Either the specified directory or its parent must be a mount
## point.
#
## default: /mnt/daos
#scm_mount_path: /mnt/daosa
#
#
## NVMe SSD whitelist
#
## Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses.
## Immutable after reformat, colons replaced by dots in PCI identifiers.
## By default, DAOS will use all the NVMe-capable SSDs that don't have active
## mount points.
#
#bdev_include: ["0000:81:00.1","0000:81:00.2","0000:81:00.3"]
#
#
## NVMe SSD blacklist
#
## Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses. Overrides drives
## listed in nvme_include and forces auto-detection to skip those drives.
## Immutable after reformat, colons replaced by dots in PCI identifiers.
#
#bdev_exclude: ["0000:81:00.1"]
#
#
## Use Hyperthreads
#
## When Hyperthreading is enabled and supported on the system, this parameter
## defines whether the DAOS service thread should only be bound to different
## physical cores (value 0) or hyperthreads (value 1).
#
## default: false
#hyperthreads: true
#
#
## Use the given directory for creating unix domain sockets
#
## DAOS Agent and DAOS Server both use unix domain sockets for communication
## with other system components. This setting is the base location to place
## the sockets in.
#
## default: /var/run/daos_server
#socket_dir: ./.daos/daos_server
#
#
## Number of hugepages to allocate for use by NVMe SSDs
#
## Specifies the number (not size) of hugepages to allocate for use by NVMe
## through SPDK. This indicates the total number to be used by any spawned
## servers. Default system hugepage size will be used and hugepages will be
## evenly distributed between CPU nodes.
#
## default: 1024
#nr_hugepages: 4096
#
#
## Force specific debug mask for daos_server (control plane).
## By default, just use the default debug mask used by daos_server.
## Mask specifies minimum level of message significance to pass to logger.
## Currently supported values are DEBUG and ERROR.
#
## default: DEBUG
#control_log_mask: ERROR
#
#
## Force specific path for daos_server (control plane) logs.
#
## default: print to stderr
#control_log_file: /tmp/daos_control.log
#
#
## Username used to lookup user uid/gid to drop privileges to if started
## as root. After control plane start-up and configuration, before starting
## data plane, process ownership will be dropped to those of supplied user.
#
#user_name: daosuser
#
#
## Group name used to lookup group gid to drop privileges to when user_name
## is root. If user is a member of group, this group gid is set for the running
## process. If group look up fails or user is not member, use uid return from
## user lookup.
#
#group_name: daosgroup
#
#
## When per-server definitions exist, auto-allocation of resources is not
## performed. Without per-server definitions, node resources will
## automatically be assigned to servers based on NUMA ratings, there will
## be a one-to-one relationship between servers and sockets.
