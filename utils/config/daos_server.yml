## DAOS server configuration file.
#
## Location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the
## path specified through the -o option of the daos_server command line.
## Otherwise, /etc/daos/daos_server.yml is used.
#
#
## Name associated with the DAOS system.
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## NOTE: Changing the DAOS system name is not supported yet.
##       It must not be changed from the default "daos_server".
#
## default: daos_server
#name: daos_server
#
#
## Access points
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## To operate, DAOS will need a quorum of access point nodes to be available.
## Must have the same value for all agents and servers in a system.
## Hosts can be specified with or without port. The default port that is set
## up in port: will be used if a port is not specified here.
#
## default: hostname of this node
#access_points: ['hostname1']
#
#
## Default control plane port
#
## Port number to bind daos_server to. This will also be used when connecting
## to access points, unless a port is specified in access_points:
#
## default: 10001
#port: 10001
#
#
## Transport credentials specifying certificates to secure communications
#
#transport_config:
#  # In order to disable transport security, uncomment and set allow_insecure
#  # to true. Not recommended for production configurations.
#  allow_insecure: false
#
#  # Location where daos_server will look for Client certificates
#  client_cert_dir: /etc/daos/certs/clients
#  # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs
#  ca_cert: /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt
#  # Server certificate for use in TLS handshakes

#
#
## Fault domain callback
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## Path to executable which will return fault domain string.
#
#fault_cb: ./.daos/fd_callback
#
#
## Network provider
#
## Force a specific libfabric provider to be used by all the engines.
## The default provider depends on the interfaces that will be auto-detected:
##  ofi+verbs for Infiniband/RoCE and
##  ofi+tcp for non-RDMA-capable Ethernet.
#
#provider: ofi+verbs
#
#
## CART: Whether to enable share address in the network stack
## (also known as scalable endpoint)
## parameters shared with client.

#
#
## CART: global RPC timeout
## parameters shared with client.
#
#crt_timeout: 30
#
#
## CART: Disable SRX

## does not support shared receive context, eg intel E810-C.
#
#disable_srx: false
#
## Core Dump Filter
## Optional filter to control which mappings are written to the core
## dump in the event of a crash. See the following URL for more detail:
## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html
#
#core_dump_filter: 0x13
#
## NVMe SSD inclusion list
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses.
## Colons replaced by dots in PCI identifiers.
## default: Use all the NVMe SSDs that don't have active mount points.
#
#bdev_include: ["0000:81:00.1","0000:81:00.2","0000:81:00.3"]
#
#
## NVMe SSD exclusion list
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses.
## Excludes drives listed in bdev_include and forces auto-detection to
## skip those drives.
## Colons replaced by dots in PCI identifiers.
## default: Use all the NVMe SSDs that don't have active mount points.
#
#bdev_exclude: ["0000:81:00.1"]
#
#
## Disable VFIO Driver
#
## In some circumstances it may be preferable to force SPDK to use the UIO
## driver for NVMe device access even though an IOMMU is available.
## NOTE: Use of the UIO driver requires that daos_server must run as root.
#
## default: false
#disable_vfio: true
#
#
## Enable VMD Usage
#
## The use of Intel Volume Management Devices can be optionally enabled.
## VMD needs to be available and configured in the system BIOS before use.
#
## default: false
#enable_vmd: true
#
#
## Enable NVMe SSD Hotplug
#
## When hotplug is enabled, io engine will periodically check device hot
## plug/remove event, and setup/teardown the device automatically.
#
## default: false
#enable_hotplug: true
#
#
## Use Hyperthreads
#
## When Hyperthreading is enabled and supported on the system, this parameter
## defines whether the DAOS service should try to take advantage of
## hyperthreading to scheduling different task on each hardware thread.
## Not supported yet.
#
## default: false
#hyperthreads: true
#
#
## Use the given directory for creating unix domain sockets
#
## DAOS Agent and DAOS Server both use unix domain sockets for communication
## with other system components. This setting is the base location to place
## the sockets in.
#
## NOTE: Do not change this when running under systemd control. If it needs to
##       be changed, then make sure that it matches the RuntimeDirectory setting
##       in /usr/lib/systemd/system/daos_server.service
#
## default: /var/run/daos_server
#
#socket_dir: ./.daos/daos_server
#
#
## Number of hugepages to allocate for DMA buffer memory
#
## Specifies the number (not size) of hugepages to allocate for use by NVMe
## through SPDK. Note that each target requires 1 GiB of hugepage space.
## In DAOS version 2.2 and newer, nr_hugepages specifies the total across all
## engines on a host. It needs to represent the total amount of hugepages memory
## required for all targets across all engines on a host, divided by the system
## hugepage size. If not set here, it will be automatically calculated based on
## the number of targets (using the default system hugepage size).
#
## Example: (2 engines * (16 targets/engine * 1GiB)) / 2MiB hugepage size = 16834
#
## Hugepages are mandatory with NVME SSDs configured and optional without.
## To disabled the use of hugepages when no NVMe SSDs are configured, set
## nr_hugepages to -1.
#
##nr_hugepages: -1
#
#
## Set specific debug mask for daos_server (control plane).
## The mask specifies minimum level of message significance to pass to logger.
## Currently supported values are DISABLED, ERROR, INFO and DEBUG.
#
## default: INFO
#control_log_mask: ERROR
#
#
## Force specific path for daos_server (control plane) logs.
#
## default: print to stderr
#control_log_file: /tmp/daos_server.log
#
#
## Enable daos_admin (privileged helper) logging.
#
## default: disabled (errors only to control plane log)
#helper_log_file: /tmp/daos_admin.log
#
#
## Enable daos_firmware (privileged helper) logging.
#
## default: disabled (errors only to control plane log)
#firmware_helper_log_file: /tmp/daos_firmware.log
#
#
## Enable HTTP endpoint for remote telemetry collection.
#
## default endpoint state: disabled
## default endpoint port: 9191
#telemetry_port: 9191
#
#
## When per-engine definitions exist, auto-allocation of resources is not
## performed. Without per-engine definitions, node resources will
## automatically be assigned to engines based on NUMA ratings.
