## DAOS server configuration file.
#
## Location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the
## path specified through the -o option of the daos_server command line.
## Otherwise, /etc/daos/daos_server.yml is used.
#
#
## Name associated with the DAOS system.
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## NOTE: Changing the DAOS system name is not supported yet.
##       It must not be changed from the default "daos_server".
#
## default: daos_server
#name: daos_server
#
#
## Access points
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## To operate, DAOS will need a quorum of access point nodes to be available.
## Must have the same value for all agents and servers in a system.
## Hosts can be specified with or without port. The default port that is set
## up in port: will be used if a port is not specified here.
#
## default: hostname of this node
#access_points: ['hostname1']
#
#
## Control plane metadata
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## Mandatory if MD-on-SSD bdev device roles have been assigned.
## Define a directory or partition/mountpoint to be used as the storage location for
## control plane metadata. The location specified should be persistent across reboots.
#
#control_metadata:
#  # Directory to store control plane metadata.
#  # If device is also defined, this path will be used as the mountpoint.
#  path: /home/daos_server/control_meta
#  # Storage partition to be formatted with an ext4 filesystem and mounted for
#  # control plane metadata storage.
#  device: /dev/sdb1
#
#
## Default control plane port
#
## Port number to bind daos_server to. This will also be used when connecting
## to access points, unless a port is specified in access_points:
#
## default: 10001
#port: 10001
#
#
## Transport credentials specifying certificates to secure communications
#
#transport_config:
#  # In order to disable transport security, uncomment and set allow_insecure
#  # to true. Not recommended for production configurations.
#  allow_insecure: false
#
#  # Location where daos_server will look for Client certificates

## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## Path to executable which will return fault domain string.
#
#fault_cb: ./.daos/fd_callback
#
#
## Network provider
#
## Set the network provider to be used by all the engines.
## There is no default - run "daos_server network scan" to list the
## providers that are supported on the fabric interfaces. Examples:
##
##   ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm  for libfabric with Infiniband/RoCE
##   ofi+tcp;ofi_rxm    for libfabric with non-RDMA-capable fabrics
##
## (Starting with DAOS 2.2, ofi_rxm will be automatically added to the
## libfabric verbs and tcp providers, if not explicitly specified.)

## Core Dump Filter
## Optional filter to control which mappings are written to the core
## dump in the event of a crash. See the following URL for more detail:

#
## NVMe SSD exclusion list
## Immutable after running "dmg storage format".
#
## Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses.
## Excludes drives listed and forces auto-detection to skip those drives.
## default: Use all the NVMe SSDs that don't have active mount points.
#
#bdev_exclude: ["0000:81:00.1"]
#
#
## Disable VFIO Driver
#
## In some circumstances it may be preferable to force SPDK to use the UIO
## driver for NVMe device access even though an IOMMU is available.
## NOTE: Use of the UIO driver requires that daos_server must run as root.
#
## default: false
#disable_vfio: true
#
#
## Disable VMD Usage
#
## VMD (Intel Volume Management Devices) is enabled by default but can be
## optionally disabled in which case VMD backing devices will not be visible.
#
## VMD needs to be available and configured in the system BIOS before it
## can be used. The main use case for VMD is managing NVMe SSD LED activity.
#
## default: false
#disable_vmd: true
#
#
## Enable NVMe SSD Hotplug
#
## When hotplug is enabled, io engine will periodically check device hot
## plug/remove event, and setup/teardown the device automatically.
#
## default: false
#enable_hotplug: true
#
#
## Use Hyperthreads
#
## When Hyperthreading is enabled and supported on the system, this parameter
## defines whether the DAOS service should try to take advantage of
## hyperthreading to scheduling different task on each hardware thread.
## Not supported yet.
#
## default: false
#hyperthreads: true
#
#
## Use the given directory for creating unix domain sockets
#
## DAOS Agent and DAOS Server both use unix domain sockets for communication
## with other system components. This setting is the base location to place
## the sockets in.
#
## NOTE: Do not change this when running under systemd control. If it needs to
##       be changed, then make sure that it matches the RuntimeDirectory setting
##       in /usr/lib/systemd/system/daos_server.service
#
## default: /var/run/daos_server
#
#socket_dir: ./.daos/daos_server
#
#
## Number of hugepages to allocate for DMA buffer memory
#
## Optional parameter that should only be set if overriding the automatically calculated value is
## necessary.
#
## Specifies the number (not size) of hugepages to allocate for use by NVMe
## through SPDK. Note that each target requires 1 GiB of hugepage space.
## In DAOS version 2.2 and newer, nr_hugepages specifies the total across all
## engines on a host. It needs to represent the total amount of hugepages memory
## required for all targets across all engines on a host, divided by the system
## hugepage size. If not set here, it will be automatically calculated based on
## the number of targets (using the default system hugepage size).
#
## Example: (2 engines * (16 targets/engine * 1GiB)) / 2MiB hugepage size = 16834
#
## default: 0
#nr_hugepages: 0
#
## Hugepages are mandatory with NVME SSDs configured and optional without.
## To disable the use of hugepages when no NVMe SSDs are configured, set
## disable_hugepages to true.
#
## default: false
#disable_hugepages: false
#
#
## Reserve an amount of RAM for system use when calculating the size of RAM-disks that will be
## created for DAOS I/O engines. Units are in GiB and represents the total RAM that will be
## reserved when calculating RAM-disk sizes for all engines.
#
## Optional parameter that should only be set if the automatically calculated value is unsuitable.
## In situations when a host is running applications alongside DAOS that use a significant amount
## of RAM resulting in MemAvailable value being too low to support the calculated RAM-disk size
## increasing the value will reduce the calculate size. Alternatively in situations where total
## RAM is low, reducing the value may prevent problems where RAM-disk size calculated is below the
## minimum of 4gib. Increasing the value may help avoid the potential of OOM killer terminating
## engine processes but could also result in stopping DAOS from using available memory resources.
#
## default: 16
#system_ram_reserved: 5
#
#
## Set specific debug mask for daos_server (control plane).
## The mask specifies minimum level of message significance to pass to logger.
## Currently supported values are DISABLED, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE and ERROR.
#
## default: INFO
#control_log_mask: ERROR
#
#
## Force specific path for daos_server (control plane) logs.
#
## default: print to stderr
#control_log_file: /tmp/daos_server.log
#
#
## Enable daos_server_helper (privileged helper) logging.
#
## default: disabled (errors only to control_log_file)
#helper_log_file: /tmp/daos_server_helper.log
#
#
## Enable daos_firmware_helper (privileged helper) logging.
#
## default: disabled (errors only to control_log_file)
#firmware_helper_log_file: /tmp/daos_firmware_helper.log
#
#
## Enable HTTP endpoint for remote telemetry collection.
#
## default endpoint state: disabled
## default endpoint port: 9191
#telemetry_port: 9191
#
#
## If desired, a set of client-side environment variables may be
## defined here. Note that these are intended to be defaults and
## may be overridden by manually-set environment variables when
## the client application is launched.
#client_env_vars:
#  - foo=bar
#
#
## When per-engine definitions exist, auto-allocation of resources is not
## performed. Without per-engine definitions, node resources will
## automatically be assigned to engines based on NUMA ratings.
## There will be a one-to-one relationship between engines and sockets.
