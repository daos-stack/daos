When an operation fails, DAOS returns a negative DER error.
For a full list of errors, please check
<https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/release/2.2/src/include/daos_errno.h>
(`DER_ERR_GURT_BASE` is equal to 1000, and `DER_ERR_DAOS_BASE` is equal
to 2000).

The function d_errstr() is provided in the API to convert an error
number to an error message.

## Log Files

On the server side, there are three log files created as part of normal
server operations:

|Component|Config Parameter|Example Config Value|
|-|-|-|
|Control Plane|control_log_file|/tmp/daos_server.log|
|Data Plane|log_file|/tmp/daos_engine.\*.log|
|[Privileged Helper](https://docs.daos.io/v2.2/admin/predeployment_check/#privileged-helper)|helper_log_file|/tmp/daos_admin.log|
|agent|log_file|/tmp/daos_agent.log|

### Control Plane Log

The default log level for the control plane is INFO. The following
levels may be set using the `control_log_mask` config parameter:

* DEBUG
* INFO
* ERROR

### Data Plane Log

Data Plane (`daos_engine`) logging is configured on a per-instance
basis. In other words, each section under the `servers:` section must
have its own logging configuration. The `log_file` config parameter
is converted to a D_LOG_FILE environment variable value. For more
detail, please see the [Debugging System](#debugging-system)
section of this document.

### Privileged Helper Log

By default, the privileged helper only emits ERROR-level logging which
is captured by the control plane and included in that log. If the
`helper_log_file` parameter is set in the server config, then
DEBUG-level logging will be sent to the specified file.

### Daos Agent Log

If the `log_file` config parameter is set in the agent config, then
DEBUG-level logging will be sent to the specified file.

## Debugging System

DAOS uses the debug system defined in
[CaRT](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/release/2.2/src/cart),
specifically the GURT library.
Both server and client default log is `stdout`, unless
otherwise set by `D_LOG_FILE` environment variable (client) or
`log_file` config parameter (server).

### Registered Subsystems/Facilities

The debug logging system includes a series of subsystems or facilities
which define groups for related log messages (defined per source file).
There are common facilities which are defined in GURT, as well as other
facilities that can be defined on a per-project basis (such as those for
CaRT and DAOS). DD_SUBSYS can be used to set which subsystems to enable
logging. By default all subsystems are enabled ("DD_SUBSYS=all").

-   DAOS Facilities:
    array, kv, common, tree, vos, client, server, rdb, rsvc, pool, container,
    object, placement, rebuild, tier, mgmt, bio, tests, dfs, duns, drpc,
    security, dtx, dfuse, il, csum

-   Common Facilities (GURT):
    MISC, MEM, SWIM, TELEM

-   CaRT Facilities:
    RPC, BULK, CORPC, GRP, HG, ST, IV, CTL

### Priority Logging

The priority level that outputs to stderr is set with DD_STDERR. By
default in DAOS (specific to the project), this is set to CRIT
("DD_STDERR=CRIT") meaning that all CRIT and more severe log messages
will dump to stderr. However, this is separate from the priority of
logging to "/tmp/daos.log". The priority level of logging can be set
with D_LOG_MASK, which by default is set to INFO
("D_LOG_MASK=INFO"), which will result in all messages excluding DEBUG
messages being logged. D_LOG_MASK can also be used to specify the
level of logging on a per-subsystem basis as well
("D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG,MEM=ERR").

### Debug Masks/Streams:

DEBUG messages account for a majority of the log messages, and
finer-granularity might be desired. Mask bits are set as the first
argument passed in D_DEBUG(mask, ...). To accomplish this, DD_MASK can
be set to enable different debug streams. Similar to facilities, there
are common debug streams defined in GURT, as well as other streams that
can be defined on a per-project basis (CaRT and DAOS). All debug streams
are enabled by default ("DD_MASK=all"). Convenience "group mask" values
are defined for common use cases and convenience, and consist of a
composition of multiple individual bits.

-   DAOS Debug Masks:

    -   md = metadata operations

    -   pl = placement operations

    -   mgmt = pool management

    -   epc = epoch system

    -   df = durable format

    -   rebuild = rebuild process

    -   group_default = (group mask) io, md, pl, and rebuild operations

    -   group_metadata_only = (group mask) mgmt, md operations

    -   group_metadata = (group mask) group_default plus mgmt operations

-   Common Debug Masks (GURT):

    -   any = generic messages, no classification

    -   trace = function trace, tree/hash/lru operations

    -   mem = memory operations

    -   net = network operations

    -   io = object I/Otest = test programs

### Common Use Cases

Please note: where in these examples the export command is shown setting an environment variable,
this is intended to convey either that the variable is actually set (for the client environment), or
configured for the engines in the `daos_server.yml` file (`log_mask` per engine, and env_vars
values per engine for the `DD_SUBSYS` and `DD_MASK` variable assignments).

-   Generic setup for all messages (default settings)

        D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG
        DD_SUBSYS=all
        DD_MASK=all

-   Disable all logs for performance tuning

        D_LOG_MASK=ERR -> will only log error messages from all facilities
        D_LOG_MASK=FATAL -> will only log system fatal messages

-   Gather daos metadata logs if a pool/container resource problem is observed, using the provided group mask

        D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG -> log at DEBUG level from all facilities
        DD_MASK=group_metadata -> limit logging to include default and metadata-specific streams. Or, specify DD_MASK=group_metadata_only for just metadata-specific log entries.

-   Disable a noisy debug logging subsystem

        D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG,MEM=ERR -> disables MEM facility by
        restricting all logs from that facility to ERROR or higher priority only
        D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG,SWIM=ERR,RPC=ERR,HG=ERR -> disables SWIM and RPC/HG facilities

-   Enable a subset of facilities of interest

        DD_SUBSYS=rpc,tests
        D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG -> required to see logs for RPC and TESTS
        less severe than INFO (the majority of log messages)

-   Fine-tune the debug messages by setting a debug mask

        D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG
        DD_MASK=mgmt -> only logs DEBUG messages related to pool
        management

Refer to the DAOS Environment Variables document for
more information about the debug system environment.

## Common DAOS Problems
### Incompatible Agent ####
When DER_AGENT_INCOMPAT is received, it means that the client library libdaos.so
is likely mismatched with the DAOS Agent.  The libdaos.so, DAOS Agent and DAOS
Server must be built from compatible sources so that the GetAttachInfo protocol
is the same between each component.  Depending on your situation, you will need
to either update the DAOS Agent or the libdaos.so to the newer version in order
to maintain compatibility with each other.

### HLC Sync ###
When DER_HLC_SYNC is received, it means that sender and receiver HLC timestamps
are off by more than maximum allowed system clock offset (1 second by default).

In order to correct this situation synchronize all server clocks to the same
reference time, using services like NTP.

### Shared Memory Errors ###
When DER_SHMEM_PERMS is received it means that this I/O Engine lacked the
permissions to access the shared memory megment left behind by a previous run of
the I/O Engine on the same machine.  This happens when the I/O Engine fails to
remove the shared memory segment upon shutdown, and, there is a mismatch between
the user/group used to launch the I/O Engine between these successive runs.  To
remedy the problem, manually identify the shared memory segment and remove it.

Issue ```ipcs``` to view the Shared Memory Segments.  The output will show a
list of segments organized by ```key```.

```
ipcs

------ Message Queues --------
key        msqid      owner      perms      used-bytes   messages

------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0xffffffff 49938432   root       666        40         0
0x10242048 98598913   jbrosenz   660        1048576    0
0x10242049 98631682   jbrosenz   660        1048576    0

------ Semaphore Arrays --------
key        semid      owner      perms      nsems
```

Shared Memory Segments with keys [0x10242048 .. (0x10242048 + number of I/O
Engines running)] are the segments that must be removed.  Use ```ipcrm``` to
remove the segment.

For example, to remove the shared memory segment left behind by I/O Engine
instance 0, issue:
```
sudo ipcrm -M 0x10242048
```
To remove the shared memory segment left behind by I/O Engine instance 1, issue:
```
sudo ipcrm -M 0x10242049
```

### Server Start Issues
1. Read the log located in the `control_log_file`.
1. Verify that the `daos_server` process is not currently running.
1. Check the SCM device path in /dev.
1. Verify the PCI addresses using `dmg storage scan`.

    !!! note
        A server must be started with minimum setup.
        You can also obtain the addresses with `daos_server storage scan`.

1. Format the SCMs defined in the config file.
1. Generate the config file using `dmg config generate`. The various requirements will be populated without a syntax error.
1. Try starting with `allow_insecure: true`. This will rule out the credential certificate issue.
1. Verify that the `access_points` host is accessible and the port is not used.
1. Check the `provider` entry. See the "Network Scan and Configuration" section of the admin guide for determining the right provider to use.
1. Check `fabric_iface` in `engines`. They should be available and enabled.
1. Check that `socket_dir` is writeable by the daos_server.

### Errors creating a Pool
1. Check which engine rank you want to create a pool in with `dmg system query --verbose` and verify their State is Joined.
1. `DER_NOSPACE(-1007)` appears: Check the size of the NVMe and PMEM. Next, check the size of the existing pool. Then check that this new pool being created will fit into the remaining disk space.

### Problems creating a container
1. Check that the path to daos is your intended binary. It's usually `/usr/bin/daos`.
1. When the server configuration is changed, it's necessary to restart the agent.
1. `DER_UNREACH(-1006)`: Check the socket ID consistency between PMEM and NVMe. First, determine which socket you're using with `daos_server network scan -p all`. e.g., if the interface you're using in the engine section is eth0, find which NUMA Socket it belongs to. Next, determine the disks you can use with this socket by calling `daos_server storage scan` or `dmg storage scan`. e.g., if eth0 belongs to NUMA Socket 0, use only the disks with 0 in the Socket ID column.
1. Check the interface used in the server config (`fabric_iface`) also exists in the client and can communicate with the server.
1. Check the access_points of the agent config points to the correct server host.
1. Call `daos pool query` and check that the pool exists and has free space.

### Applications run slow
Verify if you're using Infiniband for `fabric_iface`: in the server config. The IO will be significantly slower with Ethernet.

## Common Errors and Workarounds

### Use dmg command without daos_admin privilege

	# Error message or timeout after dmg system query
	$ dmg system query
	ERROR: dmg: Unable to load Certificate Data: could not load cert: stat /etc/daos/certs/admin.crt: no such file or directory

	# Workaround

	# 1. Make sure the admin-host /etc/daos/daos_control.yml is correctly configured.
		# including:
			# hostlist: <daos_server_lists>
			# port: <port_num>
			# transport\config:
				# allow_insecure: <true/false>
				# ca\cert: /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt
				# cert: /etc/daos/certs/admin.crt
				# key: /etc/daos/certs/admin.key

	# 2. Make sure the admin-host allow_insecure mode matches the applicable servers.

### use daos command before daos_agent started

	$ daos cont create $DAOS_POOL
	daos ERR  src/common/drpc.c:217 unixcomm_connect() Failed to connect to /var/run/daos_agent/daos_agent.sock, errno=2(No such file or directory)

## Syslog

[`RAS events`](https://docs.daos.io/v2.2/admin/administration/#ras-events) are printed to the Syslog
by 'daos_server' processes via the Go standard library API.
If no Syslog daemon is configured on the host, errors will be printed to the 'daos_server' log file:

```
ERROR: failed to create syslogger with priority 30 (severity=ERROR, facility=DAEMON): Unix syslog delivery error
```

These errors will not prevent DAOS from running as expected but indicate that no Syslog messages
will be delivered.

'rsyslog' is the Syslog daemon shipped with most operating systems and to check if the service is
running under systemd run the following command:

```
# sudo systemctl status rsyslog
● rsyslog.service - System Logging Service
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

To configure a Syslog daemon to resolve the delivery errors and receive messages from 'daos_server'
consult the relevant operating system specific documentation for installing and/or enabling a syslog
server package e.g. 'rsyslog'.

## Bug Report

Bugs should be reported through our [issue tracker](https://jira.daos.io/)
with a test case to reproduce the issue (when applicable) and debug logs.

After creating a ticket, logs should be gathered from the locations
described in the [Log Files](#log-files) section of this document and
attached to the ticket.

To avoid problems with attaching large files, please attach the logs
in a compressed container format, such as .zip or .tar.bz2.
