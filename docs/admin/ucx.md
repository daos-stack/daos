# UCX Fabric Support (DAOS 2.2 Technology Preview)

DAOS 2.2 includes a technology preview of
[UCX](https://www.openucx.org/) support for clusters using InfiniBand,
as an alternative to the default
[libfabric](https://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/) network stack.

!!! note UCX support has been enabled for the DAOS builds on
         EL8 and Leap15 only. It is not supported on CentOS7.

The goal of this technology preview is to allow early
evaluation and testing. DAOS over UCX has not been fully
validated yet, and it is not recommended to use it in a
production environment with DAOS 2.2.
It is a roadmap item to fully support UCX in DAOS 2.4.

!!! note The network provider is an immutable property of a DAOS system.
         Changing the network provider to UCX requires that the DAOS storage
         is reformatted. 

To enable DAOS UCX support on InfiniBand fabrics,
the following steps are needed:

*  A supported version of MLNX\_OFED must be installed _before_
   DAOS is installed. This is the same for libfabric and for UCX:
   DAOS only supports the NVIDIA-provided MLNX\_OFED stack,
   not the inbox drivers.
   Refer to the [DAOS Support Matrix](../release/support_matrix)
   for information about supported MLNX\_OFED releases.

*  The `mercury-ucx` RPM package needs to be **manually** selected for
   installation: For the technology preview, the `mercury` package is
   provided in two different versions, which are mutually exclusive:

   - The standard `mercury` RPM does support libfabric,
     but not UCX. This RPM will be installed by default,
     and **must** be used in non-InfiniBand environments.

   - A new `mercury-ucx` RPM is also provided, which supports
     _both_ libfabric and UCX. This RPM **must** be used in
     InfiniBand environments when the intention is to use
     UCX. It **may** also be used in InfiniBand environments
     if the intention is to use libfabric.
     Attempts to install this RPM in non-Infiniband environments
     will fail, because it has a dependency on UCX packages.

*  At DAOS **installation** time, to enable UCX support the new
   `mercury-ucx` RPM package must be explicitly listed in 
   order to prevent the installation of the default `mercury`
   package (which does not include the UCX support).
   For example, using the `yum` package manager on EL8:

```bash
      # on DAOS_ADMIN nodes:
      yum install mercury-ucx daos-admin

      # on DAOS_SERVER nodes:
      yum install mercury-ucx daos-server

      # on DAOS_CLIENT nodes:
      yum install mercury-ucx daos-client
```

*  To **change** an existing DAOS installation from libfabric to
   UCX, the default `mercury` RPM first needs to be un-installed, and
   the `mercury-ucx` RPM must be installed instead. To prevent the
   removal of DAOS altogether (it has a package dependency on mercury),
   the `rpm` command with the `--nodeps` option should be used:

```bash
      # on EL8:
      rpm -e --nodeps mercury
      yum install mercury-ucx

      # on Leap15:
      rpm -e --nodeps mercury
      zypper install mercury-ucx
```

*  To **update** from DAOS 2.0 (with libfabric) to DAOS 2.2 with
   UCX, the recommended path is to first perform a standard DAOS
   RPM update (which will update the default `mercury` package).
   After the update, the `mercury` RPM package can be replaced by
   `mercury-ucx` as described above.

After UCX support has been enabled by installing the `mercury-ucx`
package, the network provider must be changed in the DAOS server's
configuration file (`/etc/daos/daos_server.yml`).
A sample YML file is available on
[github](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/utils/config/examples/daos_server_ucx.yml).
The recommended setting for UCX is `provider: ucx+dc_x`.
