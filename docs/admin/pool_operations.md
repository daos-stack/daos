# Pool Operations

A DAOS pool is a storage reservation that can span any number of storage engines in a
DAOS system. Pools are managed by the administrator. The amount of space allocated
to a pool is decided at creation time with the `dmg pool create` command.
Pools can be expanded at a later time with the `dmg pool expand` command
that adds additional engine ranks to the existing pool's storage allocation.
The DAOS management API also provides these capabilities.


## Pool Basics

The `dmg pool` command is the main administrative tool to manage pools.
Its subcommands can be grouped into the following areas:

* Commands to create, list, query, extend, and destroy a pool.
  These are the basic functions to manage the storage allocation in a pool.

* Commands to list and set pool properties,
  and commands to set and list Access Control Lists (ACLs) for a pool.

* Commands to manage failures and other non-standard scenarios.
  This includes draining, excluding and re-integrating targets,
  and evicting client connections to a pool.

* An upgrade command to upgrade a pool's format version
  after a DAOS software upgrade.


### Creating a Pool

A DAOS pool can be created through the `dmg pool create` command.
The mandatory parameters that are needed for the creation of a pool
are the pool label, and a specification of the size of the storage
allocation.

The pool label must consist of alphanumeric characters, colon (`:`),
period (`.`), hyphen (`-`) or underscore (`_`).
The maximum length of a pool label is 127 characters.
Labels that can be parsed as a UUID (e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000)
are forbidden. Pool labels must be unique across the DAOS system.

A pool's size is determined by two factors: How many storage engines are
participating in the storage allocation, and how much capacity in each
storage tier is allocated (the latter can be specified either on a per-engine
basis, or as the total for the pool across all participating engines).
The same amount of storage will be allocated on each of the participating
storage engines. If one or more of those engines do not have sufficient free
space for the requested capacity, the pool creation will fail.

If neither the `--nranks` nor the `--ranks` option is used,
then the pool will span all storage engines of the DAOS system.
To limit the pool to only a subset of the engines, those two options
can be used to specify either the desired number of engines,
or an explicit list of engine ranks to be used for this pool.

The capacity of the pool can be specified in three different ways:

1. The `--size` option can be used to specify the _total_ pool
   capacity in **Bytes**. This value denotes the sum of the SCM
   and NVMe capacities. The relative contributions of the SCM and
   NVMe storage tiers to the total pool size are determined by the
   `--tier-ratio` parameter.
   By default this ratio is `6,94`, so for a pool of size 100TB
   there will be 6TB of SCM and 94 TB of NVMe storage.
   An SCM-only pool can be created by using `--tier-ratio 100,0`.

2. The `--size` option can be used to specify the _total_ pool
   capacity as a **percentage of the currently free capacity**.
   In this case, the tier ratio will be ignored. For example,
   requesting `--size=100%` will allocate 100% of the free SCM
   capacity and 100% of the free NVMe capacity to the pool,
   regardless of the ratio of those two free capacity values.

   * This implies that it is not possible to create an SCM-only
     pool by using a percentage size (unless there is no NVMe
     storage in the system at all, and all pools are SCM-only).

   * If the amount of free space is different across the
     participating engines, then the _minimum_ free space is
     used to calculate the space that is allocated per engine.

   * Because the percentage numbers refer to currently free
     space and not total space, the absolute size of a pool
     created with `--size=percentage%` will be impacted by other
     concurrent pool create operations. The command output will
     always list the total capacities in addition to the
     requested percentage.

3. The `--scm-size` parameter (and optionally `--nvme-size`) can
   be used to specify the SCM capacity (and optionally the NVMe
   capacity) _per storage engine_ in **Bytes**.
   The minimum SCM size is 16 MiB per **target**, so for a storage
   engine with 16 targets the minimum is `--scm-size=256MiB`.
   The NVMe size can be zero. If it is non-zero then the minimum
   NVMe size is 1 GiB per **target**, so for a storage engine
   with 16 targets the minimum non-zero NVMe size is
   `--nvme-size=16GiB`.
   To derive the total pool capacity, these per-engine capacities
   have to be multiplied by the number of participating engines.

!!! note
    The suffixes "M", "MB", "G", "GB", "T" or "TB" denote base-10
    capacities, whereas "MiB", "GiB" or "TiB" denote base-2.
    So in the first example above, specifying `--scm-size=256GB`
    would fail as 256 GB is smaller than the minimum 256 GiB.

!!! warning
    Concurrent creation of pools using **size percentage** could lead to
    `ENOSPACE` errors.  Indeed, these operations are not atomic and the overall
    available size retrieved in the first step could be different from the size
    actually available when the second step will be performed (i.e. allocation
    of space for the pool).

Examples:

To create a pool labeled `tank`:
```bash
$ dmg pool create --size=${N}TB tank
```

This command creates a pool labeled `tank` distributed across the DAOS servers
with a target size on each server that is comprised of $N * 0.94 TB of NVMe storage
and $N * 0.06 TB of SCM storage. The default SCM:NVMe ratio
may be adjusted at pool creation time as described above.

The UUID allocated to the newly created pool is printed to stdout
as well as the pool service replica ranks.

```bash
$ dmg pool create --help
...

[create command options]
      -g, --group=      DAOS pool to be owned by given group, format name@domain
      -u, --user=       DAOS pool to be owned by given user, format name@domain
      -P, --properties= Pool properties to be set
      -a, --acl-file=   Access Control List file path for DAOS pool
      -z, --size=       Total size of DAOS pool (auto)
      -t, --tier-ratio= Percentage of storage tiers for pool storage (auto) (default: 6% SCM, 94% NVMe)
      -k, --nranks=     Number of ranks to use (auto)
      -v, --nsvc=       Number of pool service replicas
      -s, --scm-size=   Per-engine SCM allocation for DAOS pool (manual)
      -n, --nvme-size=  Per-engine NVMe allocation for DAOS pool (manual)
      -r, --ranks=      Storage engine unique identifiers (ranks) for DAOS pool
```

The typical output of this command is as follows:

```bash
$ dmg pool create --size 50GB tank
Creating DAOS pool with automatic storage allocation: 50 GB total, 6,94 tier ratio
Pool created with 6.00% SCM/NVMe ratio
-----------------------------------------
  UUID                 : 8a05bf3a-a088-4a77-bb9f-df989fce7cc8
  Service Ranks        : [1-5]
  Storage Ranks        : [0-15]
  Total Size           : 50 GB
  Storage tier 0 (SCM) : 3.0 GB (188 MB / rank)
  Storage tier 1 (NVMe): 47 GB (3.0 GB / rank)
```

This created a pool with UUID 8a05bf3a-a088-4a77-bb9f-df989fce7cc8,
with pool service redundancy enabled by default (pool service replicas on ranks
1-5). If no redundancy is desired, use `--properties=svc_rf:0` to set the pool
service redundancy property to 0 (or `--nsvc=1`).

Note that it is difficult to determine the usable space by the user, and
currently we cannot provide the precise value. The usable space depends not only
on pool size, but also on number of targets, target size, object class,
storage redundancy factor, etc.


#### Creating a pool in MD-on-SSD mode

In MD-on-SSD mode, a pool is made up of a single component in memory (RAM-disk
associated with each engine) and three components on storage (NVMe SSD). The
components in storage are related to "roles" WAL, META and DATA and roles are
assigned to hardware devices in the
[server configuration file](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/admin/deployment/#server-configuration-file).

In MD-on-SSD mode pools are by default created with equal allocations for
metadata-in-memory and metadata-on-SSD but it is possible to change this. To
create a pool with a metadata-on-SSD allocation size that is double what is
allocated in memory, set `dmg pool create --mem-ratio` option to `50%`. This
implies that the ratio of metadata on memory and on storage should be 0.5 and
therefore metadata-on-SSD allocation is twice that of metadata-in-memory.

#### MD-on-SSD dmg pool create --mem-ratio examples

These examples cover the recommended way to create a pool in MD-on-SSD
mode with a fractional mem-ratio and using the `--size` percentage option.

1. The first simplistic example is run on a single host with a single
rank/engine where bdev roles META and DATA are not shared.

This is a snippet of the server config file engine section showing storage
definitions with `bdev_roles` "meta" and "data" assigned to separate tiers:
```bash
    storage:
      -
        class: ram
        scm_mount: /mnt/daos
      -
        class: nvme
        bdev_list: ["0000:81:00.0"]
        bdev_roles: [wal,meta]
      -
        class: nvme
        bdev_list: ["0000:82:00.0"]
        bdev_roles: [data]
```

This pool command requests to use all available storage and maintain a 1:1
Memory-File to Metadata-Storage size ratio (mem-ratio):
```bash
$ dmg pool create bob --size 100% --mem-ratio 100%

Pool created with 15.91%,84.09% storage tier ratio
--------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : cf70ac58-a9cd-4efd-8a96-a53697353633
  Service Leader   : 0
  Service Ranks    : 0
  Storage Ranks    : 0
  Total Size       : 951 GB
  Metadata Storage : 151 GB (151 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 800 GB (800 GB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 151 GB (151 GB / rank)
```

Rough calculations: `dmg storage scan` shows that for each rank, one 800GB SSD
is assigned for each tier (first: WAL+META, second: DATA). `df -h /mnt/daos*`
reports usable ramdisk capacity for the single rank is 142 GiB (152 GB).
- Expected Data storage would then be 800GB for the pool (one rank).
- Expected Meta storage at 100% mem-ratio would be the total ramdisk capacity.
- Expected Memory-File size would be identical to Meta storage size.


2. If the `--mem-ratio` is reduced to 50% in the above example, we end up with
double the Metadata-Storage size compared to Memory-File size (because a larger
proportion of META is allocated due to the change in mem-ratio) and this results
in a larger total pool size:

```bash
$ dmg pool create bob --size 100% --mem-ratio 50%

Pool created with 27.46%,72.54% storage tier ratio
--------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : 8e2cf446-3382-4d69-9b84-51e4e9a20c08
  Service Leader   : 0
  Service Ranks    : 0
  Storage Ranks    : 0
  Total Size       : 1.1 TB
  Metadata Storage : 303 GB (303 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 800 GB (800 GB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 151 GB (151 GB / rank)
```


3. If we then try the same with bdev roles META and DATA are shared. Here we
can illustrate how metadata overheads are accommodated for when the same
devices share roles (and will be used to store both metadata and data).

This is a snippet of the server config file engine section showing storage
definitions with `bdev_roles` "meta" and "data" assigned to the same (single)
tier:
```bash
    storage:
      -
        class: ram
        scm_mount: /mnt/daos
      -
        class: nvme
        bdev_list: ["0000:81:00.0", "0000:82:00.0"]
        bdev_roles: [wal,meta,data]
```

This pool command requests to use all available storage and maintain a 1:1
Memory-File to Metadata-Storage size ratio (mem-ratio):
```bash
$ dmg pool create bob --size 100% --mem-ratio 100%

Pool created with 17.93%,82.07% storage tier ratio
--------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : b24df7a5-17d5-4e87-9986-2dff18078b6e
  Service Leader   : 0
  Service Ranks    : 0
  Storage Ranks    : 0
  Total Size       : 1.5 TB
  Metadata Storage : 151 GB (151 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 1.3 TB (1.3 TB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 151 GB (151 GB / rank)
```

Looking at this output and comparing with example no. 1 we observe that
because both SSDs are sharing META and DATA roles, more capacity is available
for DATA.


4. If the `--mem-ratio` is then reduced to 50% in the above example, we end up
with double the Metadata-Storage size which detracts from the DATA capacity.

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create bob -z 100% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 100% of all storage
Pool created with 20.32%,79.68% storage tier ratio
--------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : 2b4147eb-ade3-4d76-82c4-b9c2c377f8d1
  Service Leader   : 0
  Service Ranks    : 0
  Storage Ranks    : 0
  Total Size       : 1.5 TB
  Metadata Storage : 303 GB (303 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 1.2 TB (1.2 TB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 151 GB (151 GB / rank)
```

META has been doubled at the cost of DATA capacity.


5. Adding another engine/rank on the same host results in more than double DATA
capacity because RAM-disk capacity is halved across two engines/ranks on the same
host and this results in a reduction of META and increase in DATA per-rank sizes.
The RAM-disk capacity for each engine is based on half of the available system
RAM. When only one engine exists on the host, all of the available system RAM
(less some calculated reserve) is used for the engine RAM-disk.

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create bob -z 100% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 100% of all storage
Pool created with 8.65%,91.35% storage tier ratio
-------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : ee7af142-3d72-45bf-9dc2-e1060c0de5be
  Service Leader   : 1
  Service Ranks    : [0-1]
  Storage Ranks    : [0-1]
  Total Size       : 3.0 TB
  Metadata Storage : 258 GB (129 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 2.7 TB (1.4 TB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 129 GB (64 GB / rank)
```


6. A larger pool with 6 engines/ranks across 3 hosts using the same shared-role
configuration and pool-create commandline as the previous example.

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create bob -z 100% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 100% of all storage
Pool created with 8.65%,91.35% storage tier ratio
-------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : 678833f3-ba0a-4947-a2e8-cef45c3c3977
  Service Leader   : 3
  Service Ranks    : [0-1,3-5]
  Storage Ranks    : [0-5]
  Total Size       : 8.9 TB
  Metadata Storage : 773 GB (129 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 8.2 TB (1.4 TB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 386 GB (64 GB / rank)
```

Here the size has increased linearly with the per-rank sizes remaining the
same.


7. Now for a more involved example with shared roles. Create two pools of
roughly equal size each using half available capacity and a `--mem-ratio` of
50%.

An administrator can use the `dmg storage query usage` command to gauge
available capacity across ranks and tiers. Adding `--show-usable` flag shows
capacity that could be used to store DATA once META overheads of a new pool
have been taken into account:

```bash
$ dmg -i storage query usage --show-usable --mem-ratio 50% -l wolf-[310-312]

Tier Roles
---- -----
T1   data,meta,wal

Rank T1-Total T1-Usable T1-Usage
---- -------- --------- --------
0    1.6 TB   1.4 TB    14 %
1    1.6 TB   1.4 TB    14 %
2    1.6 TB   1.4 TB    14 %
3    1.6 TB   1.4 TB    14 %
4    1.6 TB   1.4 TB    14 %
5    1.6 TB   1.4 TB    14 %
```

The last column indicates the percentage of the total capacity that is not
usable for new pool data.

First create a pool using 50% of available capacity:

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create bob -z 50% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 50% of all storage
Pool created with 8.65%,91.35% storage tier ratio
-------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : 11b9dd1f-edc9-47c7-a61f-cee52d0e7ed4
  Service Leader   : 3
  Service Ranks    : [1-5]
  Storage Ranks    : [0-5]
  Total Size       : 4.5 TB
  Metadata Storage : 386 GB (64 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 4.1 TB (681 GB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 193 GB (32 GB / rank)
```

`dmg storage query usage` can be used to show available capacity on each
rank and tier after the first pool has been created:

```bash
$ dmg -i storage query usage -l wolf-[310-312]

Tier Roles
---- -----
T1   data,meta,wal

Rank T1-Total T1-Free T1-Usage
---- -------- ------- --------
0    1.6 TB   749 GB  53 %
1    1.6 TB   749 GB  53 %
2    1.6 TB   749 GB  53 %
3    1.6 TB   752 GB  53 %
4    1.6 TB   749 GB  53 %
5    1.6 TB   749 GB  53 %
```

`dmg storage query usage --show-usable` can show usable capacity taking into
account META overheads:

```bash
$ dmg -i storage query usage --show-usable --mem-ratio 50% -l wolf-[310-312]

Tier Roles
---- -----
T1   data,meta,wal

Rank T1-Total T1-Usable T1-Usage
---- -------- --------- --------
0    1.6 TB   573 GB    64 %
1    1.6 TB   573 GB    64 %
2    1.6 TB   573 GB    64 %
3    1.6 TB   578 GB    63 %
4    1.6 TB   573 GB    64 %
5    1.6 TB   573 GB    64 %
```

Second create a pool using 100% of remaining capacity:

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create ben -z 100% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 100% of all storage
Pool created with 9.80%,90.20% storage tier ratio
-------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : 48391eed-71b2-47b4-9ad1-780c7143c027
  Service Leader   : 5
  Service Ranks    : [0,2-5]
  Storage Ranks    : [0-5]
  Total Size       : 3.8 TB
  Metadata Storage : 374 GB (62 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 3.4 TB (573 GB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 187 GB (31 GB / rank)
```

The Memory-File-Size is roughly half the dual-rank-per-host RAM-disk size of 64
GB. The META per-rank size is double the Memory-File-Size as expected for a 50%
mem-ratio.

Comparing per-rank values with example no. 6 & 7, we can see that the first
pool has roughly 50% META and DATA pe-rank values as expected. The second
created pool is slightly smaller meaning the total cumulative pool size reading
`4.5+3.8 == 8.3 TB` rather than `8.9 TB` which can be partly explained because
of extra per-pool overheads and possible rounding in size calculations.


8. Now for a similar experiment as example no. 8 but with separate META and
DATA roles.

```bash
$ dmg -i storage query usage --show-usable --mem-ratio 50% -l wolf-[310-312]
Tier Roles
---- -----
T1   meta,wal
T2   data

Rank T1-Total T1-Usable T1-Usage T2-Total T2-Usable T2-Usage
---- -------- --------- -------- -------- --------- --------
0    800 GB   800 GB    0 %      800 GB   800 GB    0 %
1    800 GB   800 GB    0 %      800 GB   800 GB    0 %
2    800 GB   800 GB    0 %      800 GB   800 GB    0 %
3    800 GB   800 GB    0 %      800 GB   800 GB    0 %
4    800 GB   800 GB    0 %      800 GB   800 GB    0 %
5    800 GB   800 GB    0 %      800 GB   800 GB    0 %
```

Because META and DATA roles exist on separate tiers, usable space is the same
as free.

First create a pool using 50% of available capacity:

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create bob -z 50% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 50% of all storage
Pool created with 13.87%,86.13% storage tier ratio
--------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : 0b8a7b40-25d6-44a6-9c1b-23cea0aa3ea2
  Service Leader   : 0
  Service Ranks    : [0-2,4-5]
  Storage Ranks    : [0-5]
  Total Size       : 2.8 TB
  Metadata Storage : 386 GB (64 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 2.4 TB (400 GB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 193 GB (32 GB / rank)
```

Pool size is now much smaller because DATA is confined to a single SSD on
single tier and META is limited by Memory-File-Size.

`dmg storage query usage` can be used to show available capacity on each rank
and tier after the first pool has been created:

```bash
$ dmg -i storage query usage -l wolf-[310-312]
Tier Roles
---- -----
T1   meta,wal
T2   data

Rank T1-Total T1-Free T1-Usage T2-Total T2-Free T2-Usage
---- -------- ------- -------- -------- ------- --------
0    800 GB   629 GB  21 %     800 GB   400 GB  49 %
1    800 GB   629 GB  21 %     800 GB   400 GB  49 %
2    800 GB   629 GB  21 %     800 GB   400 GB  49 %
3    800 GB   632 GB  20 %     800 GB   400 GB  49 %
4    800 GB   629 GB  21 %     800 GB   400 GB  49 %
5    800 GB   629 GB  21 %     800 GB   400 GB  49 %
```

Second create a pool using 100% of remaining capacity:

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create ben -z 100% --mem-ratio 50%

Creating DAOS pool with 100% of all storage
Pool created with 13.47%,86.53% storage tier ratio
--------------------------------------------------
  UUID             : ac90de4b-522e-40de-ab50-da4c85b1000d
  Service Leader   : 5
  Service Ranks    : [0-2,4-5]
  Storage Ranks    : [0-5]
  Total Size       : 2.8 TB
  Metadata Storage : 374 GB (62 GB / rank)
  Data Storage     : 2.4 TB (400 GB / rank)
  Memory File Size : 187 GB (31 GB / rank)
```

It should be noted that this example is only with one SSD per tier and is not
necessarily representative of a production environment. The purpose is to give
some idea of how to use the tool commands.

Capacity can be best utilized by understanding assignment of roles and SSDs
across tiers and the tuning of the mem-ratio pool create option.


### Listing Pools

To see a list of the pools in the DAOS system:

```bash
$ dmg pool list
Pool     Size   Used Imbalance Disabled
----     ----   ---- --------- --------
tank     47 GB  0%   0%        0/32
```

This returns a table of pool labels (or UUIDs if no label was specified)
with the following information for each pool:
- The total pool size (NVMe or DATA tier, not including Metadata tier).
- The percentage of used space (i.e., 100 * used space  / total space)
  for the NVMe or DATA tier.
- The imbalance percentage indicating whether data distribution across
  the difference storage targets is well balanced. 0% means that there is
  no imbalance and 100% means that out-of-space errors might be returned
  by some storage targets while space is still available on others. Applies
  only for the NVMe or DATA tier.
- The number of disabled targets (0 here) and the number of targets that
  the pool was originally configured with (total).

The --verbose option provides more detailed information including the
number of service replicas, the full UUIDs and space distribution
between SCM and NVMe (or META and DATA in MD-on-SSD mode) for each pool:

```bash
$ dmg pool list --verbose
Label UUID                                 SvcReps SCM Size SCM Used SCM Imbalance NVME Size NVME Used NVME Imbalance Disabled
----- ----                                 ------- -------- -------- ------------- --------- --------- -------------- --------

```

In MD-on-SSD mode:
```bash
$ dmg pool list --verbose
Label UUID                                 SvcReps Meta Size Meta Used Meta Imbalance DATA Size DATA Used DATA Imbalance Disabled
----- ----                                 ------- --------- --------- -------------- --------- --------- -------------- --------
tank  8a05bf3a-a088-4a77-bb9f-df989fce7cc8 1-3     3 GB      10 kB     0%             47 GB     0 B       0%             0/32
```

### Destroying a Pool

To destroy a pool labeled `tank`:

```bash
$ dmg pool destroy tank
Pool-destroy command succeeded
```

The pool's UUID can be used instead of the pool label.

To destroy a pool which has active connections (open pool handles will be evicted before pool is
destroyed):

```bash
$ dmg pool destroy tank --force
Pool-destroy command succeeded
```

To destroy a pool despite the existence of associated containers:

```bash
$ dmg pool destroy tank --recursive
Pool-destroy command succeeded
```

Without the --recursive flag, destroy will fail if containers exist in the pool.

### Querying a Pool

The pool query operation retrieves information (i.e., the number of targets,
space usage, rebuild status, property list, and more) about an existing pool.

To query a pool labeled `tank`:

```bash
$ dmg pool query tank
```

The pool's UUID can be used instead of the pool label.
Below is the output for a pool created with SCM space only.

```bash
    pool=47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a
    Pool 47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a, ntarget=64, disabled=8
    Pool space info:
    - Target(VOS) count:56
    - SCM:
        Total size: 28GB
        Free: 28GB, min:505MB, max:512MB, mean:512MB
    - NVMe:
        Total size: 0
        Free: 0, min:0, max:0, mean:0
    Rebuild done, 10 objs, 1026 recs
```

The total and free sizes are the sum across all the targets whereas
min/max/mean gives information about individual targets. A min value
close to 0 means that one target is running out of space.

NB: the Versioning Object Store (VOS) may reserve a portion of the
SCM and NVMe allocations to mitigate against fragmentation and for background
operations (e.g., aggregation, garbage collection). The amount of storage
set aside depends on the size of the target and may take up 2+ GB.
Therefore, out of space conditions may occur even while pool query may not
show the minimum free space approaching zero.

The example below shows a rebuild in progress and NVMe space allocated.

```bash
    pool=95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671
    Pool 95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671, ntarget=64, disabled=8
    Pool space info:
    - Target(VOS) count:56
    - SCM:
        Total size: 28GB
        Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB
    - NVMe:
        Total size: 56GB
        Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB
    Rebuild busy, 75 objs, 9722 recs
```

After experiencing significant failures, the pool may retain some suspect
engines that have been marked as DEAD by the SWIM protocol but were not excluded
from the pool to prevent potential data inconsistency. An administrator can bring
these engines back online by restarting them. The example below illustrates the
system’s status with suspect and disabled engines.

```bash
$ dmg pool query tank -t
```

NB: The --health-only/-t option is necessary to conduct pool health-related queries only.
This is important because suspect ranks may cause commands to hang and timeout so identifying
and restarting them is a useful procedure.

```bash
Pool 6f450a68-8c7d-4da9-8900-02691650f6a2, ntarget=8, disabled=2, leader=3, version=4, state=Degraded
    Pool health info:
    - Disabled ranks: 1
    - Suspect ranks: 2
    - Rebuild busy, 0 objs, 0 recs
```

Additional status and telemetry data is planned to be exported through
management tools and will be documented here once available.

### Upgrading a Pool

The pool upgrade operation upgrades a pool's disk format to the latest
pool format while preserving its data. The existing containers should
be accessible after the upgrade with the same level of functionality as
before the upgrade. New features available at the pool, container or
object level won’t be automatically enabled on existing pools unless
upgrade is performed.

NB: The pool upgrade operation will evict any existing connections
to this pool - pool will be unavailable to connect during pool upgrading.

To see all UpgradeNeeded pools:

```bash
$ dmg pool list
```

Below is an example of pool list

```bash
   Pool  Size   State Used Imbalance Disabled UpgradeNeeded?
   ----  ----   ----- ---- --------- -------- --------------
   pool1 1.0 GB Ready 0%   0%        0/4      1->2
   pool2 1.0 GB Ready 0%   0%        0/4      1->2
```

For the above example, pool1 and pool2 need to be upgraded from pool
version 1 to pool version 2.

NB: jump upgrading is not supported; e.g. upgrading pools created from
DAOS v2.0 to DAOS v2.2 is ok, but not for DAOS v2.0 to v2.4 directly.

The example below shows before and after pool upgrade.

```bash
$ dmg pool get-prop pool1

```

Duration of upgrade depends on possible format change across different DAOS releases.
It might trigger rebuild to re-place objects data which might be time-consuming.
So `dmg pool upgrade` will return within seconds, but it might take hours to see Pool Status
change from 'in progress' to 'completed'. The pool will stay offline and deny any pool connection until
pool upgrade status becomes 'completed'.

NB: once upgrade status is "completed", then the container/pool can do normal I/O,
but rebuild status might not finish due to reclaim. pool reintegrate/drain/extend can
only proceed once rebuild status is "done".

!!! warning
    Once upgrade was done, upgraded pools will become unavailable if downgrading software.

### Evicting Users

To evict handles/connections to a pool labeled `tank`:

```bash
$ dmg pool evict tank
Pool-evict command succeeded
```

The pool's UUID can be used instead of the pool label.


## Pool Properties

Properties are predefined parameters that the administrator can tune to control
the behavior of a pool.

### Properties Management

Current properties of an existing pool can be retrieved via the `dmg pool
get-prop` command line.

```bash
$ dmg pool get-prop tank

```

Some properties can be modified after pool creation via the `set-prop` option.

```bash
$ dmg pool set-prop tank2 reclaim:lazy
   pool set-prop succeeded

$ dmg pool get-prop tank2 reclaim
   Pool 1f265216-5877-4302-ad29-aa0f90df3f86 properties:
   Name                       Value
   ----                       -----
   Reclaim strategy (reclaim) lazy
```

### Reclaim Strategy (reclaim)

DAOS is a versioned object store that tags every I/O with an epoch number.
This versioning mechanism is the baseline for multi-version concurrency control and
snapshot support. Over time, unused versions need to be reclaimed in order to
release storage space and also simplify the metadata index. This process is
called aggregation.

The reclaim property defines what strategy to use to reclaimed unused version.
Three options are supported:

* "lazy"     : Trigger aggregation only when there is no IO activities or SCM free space is under pressure (default strategy)
* "time"     : Trigger aggregation regularly despite of IO activities.
* "disabled" : Never trigger aggregation. The system will eventually run out of space even if data is being deleted.

### Self-healing Policy (self\_heal)

This property defines whether a failing engine is automatically evicted from the
pool. Once excluded, the self-healing mechanism will be triggered to restore
the pool data redundancy on the surviving storage engines.
Two options are supported: "exclude" (default strategy) and "rebuild".

### Reserved Space for Rebuilds (space\_rb)

This property defines the percentage of total space reserved on each storage
engine for self-healing purpose. The reserved space cannot be consumed by
applications. Valid values are 0% to 100%, the default is 0%.
When setting this property, specifying the percentage symbol is optional:
`space_rb:2%` and `space_rb:2` both specify two percent of storage capacity.

### Data bdev threshold size (data\_thresh)

This property defines the size threshold over which data is stored on backend block device
(e.g. NVMe SSDs). Any single value or array value extent of size greater than or
equal to the data\_thresh value is stored on a block device. It is otherwise stored
in SCM. 0 is a special value meaning that data is always stored on SCM regardless of
the size. 1 implies that data is always stored on the block device.

The data threshold can be specified after the pool is created. The updated threshold applies
only to new writes and extents that haven't yet been scanned by the background aggregation
process:

```bash
$ dmg pool get-prop io500_pool data_thresh
Pool io500_pool properties:
Name                              Value
----                              -----
Data bdev threshold (data_thresh) 4.0 KiB

$ dmg pool get-prop io500_pool data_thresh
Pool io500_pool properties:
Name                              Value
----                              -----
Data bdev threshold (data_thresh) 0 B

$ dmg pool set-prop io500_pool data_thresh:8KiB
pool set-prop succeeded

$ dmg pool get-prop io500_pool data_thresh
Pool io500_pool properties:
Name                              Value
----                              -----
Data bdev threshold (data_thresh) 8.0 KiB
```

### Default EC Cell Size (ec\_cell\_sz)

This property defines the default erasure code cell size inherited to DAOS
containers. The EC cell size can be between 1kiB and 1GiB,
although it should typically be set to a value between 32kiB and 1MiB.
The default in DAOS 2.0 was 1MiB. The default in DAOS 2.2 is 64kiB.
When setting this property, the cell size can be specified in Bytes
(as a number with no suffix), with a base-10 suffix like `k` or `MB`,
or with a base-2 suffix like `ki` or `MiB`.

### Service Redundancy Factor (svc\_rf)

This property defines the number of faulty replicas the pool service shall try
to tolerate. Valid values are between 0 to 4, inclusive, with 2 being the
default. If specified during a pool create operation, this property overrides
any `--nsvc` options. This property cannot yet be changed afterward.

See [Erasure Code](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/user/container/#erasure-code) for details on
erasure coding at the container level.

### Properties for Controlling Checkpoints (Metadata on SSD only)

Checkpointing is a background process that flushes VOS metadata from the ephemeral
copy to the metadata blob storing the VOS file, enabling Write Ahead Log (WAL) space
to be reclaimed.  These properties are available to allow a user experiment with
timing of checkpointing.  They are experimental and may be removed in future versions
of DAOS.

#### Checkpoint policy (checkpoint)

This property controls how checkpoints are triggered for each target.  When enabled,
checkpointing will always trigger if there is space pressure in the WAL. There are
three supported options:

* "timed"       : Checkpointing is also triggered periodically (default option).
* "lazy"        : Checkpointing is only triggered when there is WAL space pressure.
* "disabled"    : Checkpointing is disabled.  WAL space may be exhausted.

#### Checkpoint frequency (checkpoint\_freq)

This property controls how often checkpoints are triggered. It is only relevant
if the checkpoint policy is "timed". The value is specified in seconds in the
range [1, 1000000] with a default of 5.  Values outside the range are
automatically adjusted.

#### Checkpoint threshold (checkpoint\_thresh)

This property controls the percentage of WAL usage to automatically trigger a checkpoint.
It is not relevant when the checkpoint policy is "disabled". The value is specified
as a percentage in the range [10-75] with a default of 50. Values outside the range are
automatically adjusted.

#### Reintegration mode (reintegration)

This property controls how reintegration will recover data. Two options are supported:
"data_sync" (default strategy) and "no_data_sync". with "data_sync", reintegration will
discard pool data and trigger rebuild to sync data. While with "no_data_sync", reintegration
only updates pool map to include rank.

NB: with "no_data_sync" enabled, containers will be turned to read-only, daos won't trigger
rebuild to restore the pool data redundancy on the surviving storage engines if there are
dead rank events.

## Access Control Lists

Client user and group access for pools are controlled by
[Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/overview/security/#access-control-lists).
Most pool-related tasks are performed using the DMG administrative tool, which
is authenticated by the administrative certificate rather than user-specific
credentials.

Access-controlled client pool accesses include:

* Connecting to the pool.

* Querying the pool.

* Creating containers in the pool.

* Deleting containers in the pool.

This is reflected in the set of supported
[pool permissions](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/overview/security/#permissions).

A user must be able to connect to the pool in order to access any containers
inside, regardless of their permissions on those containers.

### Ownership

By default, the `dmg pool create` command will use the current user and current
group to set the pool's owner-user and owner-group. This default can be changed
with the `--user` and `--group` options.

Pool ownership conveys no special privileges for access control decisions.
All desired privileges of the owner-user (`OWNER@`) and owner-group (`GROUP@`)
must be explicitly defined by an administrator in the pool ACL.

### ACL at Pool Creation

To create a pool with a custom ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool create --size <size> --acl-file <path> <pool_label>
```

The ACL file format is detailed in [here](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/overview/security/#acl-file).

### Displaying ACL

To view a pool's ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool get-acl --outfile=<path> <pool_label>
```

The output is in the same string format used in the ACL file during creation,
with one Access Control Entry (i.e., ACE) per line.

An example output is presented below:

```bash
$ dmg pool get-acl tank
# Owner: jlombard@
# Owner Group: jlombard@
# Entries:
A::OWNER@:rw
A::bob@:r
A:G:GROUP@:rw
```

### Modifying ACL

For all of these commands using an ACL file, the ACL file must be in the format
noted above for container creation.

#### Overwriting ACL

To replace a pool's ACL with a new ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool overwrite-acl --acl-file <path> <pool_label>
```

#### Adding and Updating ACEs

To add or update multiple entries in an existing pool ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool update-acl --acl-file <path> <pool_label>
```

To add or update a single entry in an existing pool ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool update-acl --entry <ACE> <pool_label>
```

If there is no existing entry for the principal in the ACL, the new entry is
added to the ACL. If there is already an entry for the principal, that entry
is replaced with the new one.

For instance:

```bash
$ dmg pool update-acl -e A::kelsey@:r tank
Pool-update-ACL command succeeded, UUID: 8a05bf3a-a088-4a77-bb9f-df989fce7cc8
# Owner: jlombard@
# Owner Group: jlombard@
# Entries:
A::OWNER@:rw
A::bob@:r
A::kelsey@:r
A:G:GROUP@:rw
```

#### Removing an ACE

To delete an entry for a given principal in an existing pool ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool delete-acl --principal <principal> <pool_label>
```

The principal corresponds to the principal portion of an ACE that was
set during pool creation or a previous pool ACL operation. For the delete
operation, the principal argument must be formatted as follows:

* Named user: `u:username@`
* Named group: `g:groupname@`
* Special principals: `OWNER@`, `GROUP@`, and `EVERYONE@`

The entry for that principal will be completely removed. This does not always
mean that the principal will have no access. Rather, their access to the pool
will be decided based on the remaining ACL rules.

## Pool Modifications

### Automatic Exclusion

An engine detected as dead by the SWIM monitoring protocol will, by default,
be automatically excluded from all the pools using this engine. The engine
will thus not only be marked as excluded by the system (i.e., in `dmg system
query`), but also reported as disabled in the pool query output (i.e., `dmg
pool query`) for all the impacted pools.

Upon exclusion, the collective rebuild process (i.e., also called self-healing)
will be automatically triggered to restore data redundancy on the
surviving engine.

!!! note
    The rebuild process may consume many resources on each engine and
    is thus throttled to reduce the impact on application performance. This
    current logic relies on CPU cycles on the storage nodes. By default, the
    rebuild process is configured to consume up to 30% of the CPU cycles,
    leaving the other 70% for regular I/O operations.

### Manual Exclusion

An operator can exclude one or more engines or targets from a specific DAOS pool
using the rank the target resides, as well as the target idx on that rank.
If a target idx list is not provided, all targets on the engine rank will be excluded.

To exclude a target from a pool:

```bash
$ dmg pool exclude --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3} <pool_label>
```

The pool target exclude command accepts 2 parameters:

* The engine rank of the target(s) to be excluded.
* The target indices of the targets to be excluded from that engine rank (optional).

Upon successful manual exclusion, the self-healing mechanism will be triggered
to restore redundancy on the remaining engines.

### Drain

Alternatively, when an operator would like to remove one or more engines or
targets without the system operating in degraded mode, the drain operation can
be used.
A pool drain operation initiates rebuild without excluding the designated engine
or target until after the rebuild is complete.
This allows the drained entity to continue to perform I/O while the rebuild
operation is ongoing. Drain additionally enables non-replicated data to be
rebuilt onto another target whereas in a conventional failure scenario non-replicated
data would not be integrated into a rebuild and would be lost.
Drain operation is not allowed if there are other ongoing rebuild operations, otherwise
it will return -DER_BUSY.

To drain a target from a pool:

```bash
$ dmg pool drain --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3} $DAOS_POOL
```

The pool target drain command accepts 2 parameters:

* The engine rank of the target(s) to be drained.
* The target indices of the targets to be drained from that engine rank (optional).

#### System Drain

To drain ranks or hosts from all pools that they belong to, the 'dmg system drain'
command can be used. The command takes either a host-set or rank-set:

To drain a set of hosts from all pools (drains all ranks on selected hosts):

```Bash
$ dmg system drain --rank-hosts foo-[001-100]
```

To drain a set of ranks from all pools:

```Bash
$ dmg system drain --ranks 1-100
```

### Reintegration

After an engine failure and exclusion, an operator can fix the underlying issue
and reintegrate the affected engines or targets to restore the pool to its
original state.
The operator can either reintegrate specific targets for an engine rank by
supplying a target idx list, or reintegrate an entire engine rank by omitting the list.
Reintegrate operation is not allowed if there are other ongoing rebuild operations,
otherwise it will return -DER_BUSY.

```
$ dmg pool reintegrate $DAOS_POOL --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3}
```

The pool reintegrate command accepts 3 parameters:

* The label or UUID of the pool that the targets will be reintegrated into.
* The engine rank of the affected targets.
* The target indices of the targets to be reintegrated on that engine rank (optional).

When rebuild is triggered it will list the operations and their related engines/targets
by their engine rank and target index.

```
Target (rank 5 idx 0) is down.
Target (rank 5 idx 1) is down.
...
(rank 5 idx 0) is excluded.
(rank 5 idx 1) is excluded.
```

These should be the same values used when reintegrating the targets.

```
$ dmg pool reintegrate $DAOS_POOL --rank=5 --target-idx=0,1
```

!!! warning
    While dmg pool query and list show how many targets are disabled for each
    pool, there is currently no way to list the targets that have actually
    been disabled. As a result, it is recommended for now to try to reintegrate
    all engine ranks one after the other via `for i in seq $NR_RANKs; do dmg
    pool reintegrate --rank=$i; done`. This limitation will be addressed in the
    next release.

## Pool Extension

### Addition & Space Rebalancing

Full support for online target addition and automatic space rebalancing is
planned for a future release and will be documented here once available.

Until then the following command(s) are placeholders and offer limited
functionality related to Online Server Addition/Rebalancing operations.

An operator can choose to extend a pool to include ranks not currently in the
pool.
This will automatically trigger a server rebalance operation where objects
within the extended pool will be rebalanced across the new storage.
Extend operation is not allowed if there are other ongoing rebuild operations,
otherwise it will return -DER_BUSY.

```
$ dmg pool extend $DAOS_POOL --ranks=${rank1},${rank2}...
```

The pool extend command accepts one required parameter which is a comma
separated list of engine ranks to include in the pool.

The pool rebalance operation will work most efficiently when the pool is
extended to its desired size in a single operation, as opposed to multiple,
small extensions.

### Resize

Support for quiescent pool resize (changing capacity used on each storage node
without adding new ones) is currently not supported and is under consideration.

## Pool Catastrophic Recovery

A DAOS pool is instantiated on each target by a set of pmemobj files
managed by PMDK and SPDK blobs on SSDs. Tools to verify and repair this
persistent data is scheduled for DAOS v3.0 and will be documented here
once available.

Meanwhile, PMDK provides a recovery tool (i.e., pmempool check) to verify
and possibly repair a pmemobj file. As discussed in the previous section, the
rebuild status can be consulted via the pool query and will be expanded
with more information.

## Pool Redundancy Factor

If the DAOS system experiences cascading failures, where the number of failed
fault domains exceeds a pool's redundancy factor, there could be unrecoverable
errors and applications could suffer from data loss. This can happen in cases
of power or network outages and would cause node/engine failures. In most cases
those failures can be recovered and DAOS engines can be restarted and the system
can function again.

Administrator can set the default pool redundancy factor by environment variable
"DAOS_POOL_RF" in the server yaml file. If SWIM detects and reports an engine is
dead and the number of failed fault domain exceeds or is going to exceed the pool
redundancy factor, it will not change pool map immediately. Instead, it will give
critical log message:
```
intolerable unavailability: engine rank x
```
To recover, see [Servers or engines become unavailable](troubleshooting.md#engines-become-unavailable).

## Recovering Container Ownership

Typically users are expected to manage their containers. However, in the event
that a container is orphaned and no users have the privileges to change the
ownership, an administrator can transfer ownership of the container to a new
user and/or group.

To change the owner user:

```bash
$ dmg cont set-owner --pool <UUID> --cont <UUID> --user <owner-user>
```
To change the owner group:

```bash
$ dmg cont set-owner --pool <UUID> --cont <UUID> --group <owner-group>
```

The user and group names are case sensitive and must be formatted as
[DAOS ACL user/group principals](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/overview/security/#principal).

Because this is an administrative action, it does not require the administrator
to have any privileges assigned in the container ACL.
