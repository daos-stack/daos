# Data Integrity

DAOS uses checksums internally to discover silent data corruption. While each
component in a system (network layer, storage devices) may offer protection
against silent data corruption, DAOS provides end-to-end data integrity to
better protect user data. If silent data corruption is detected, DAOS will
attempt to recover the corrupted data using data redundancy mechanisms
(Replication or Erasure Code).

## End-to-end Data Integrity

In simple terms, end-to-end means that the DAOS Client library will calculate a
checksum for data that is being sent to the DAOS Server. The DAOS Server will
store the checksum and return it upon data retrieval. Then the client verifies
the data by calculating a new checksum and comparing to the checksum received
from the server. There are variations on this approach depending on the type of
data being protected, but the following diagram shows the basic checksum flow.
![Basic Checksum Flow](../graph/data_integrity/basic_checksum_flow.png)

## Configuring

Data integrity is configured for each container.
See [Storage Model](./storage.md) for more information about how data is
organized in DAOS. See the Data Integrity in
the [Container User Guide](../user/container.md#data-integrity) for details on
how to setup a container with data integrity.

## Keys and Value Objects

Because DAOS is a key/value store, the data for both keys and values is
protected, however, the approach is slightly different. For the two different
value types, single and array, the approach is also slightly different.

### Keys
On an update and fetch, the client calculates a checksum for the data used
as the distribution and attribute keys and will send it to the server within the
RPC. The server verifies the keys with the checksum.
While enumerating keys, the server will calculate checksums for the keys and
pack within the RPC message to the client. The client will verify the keys
received.

!!! note
    Checksums for keys are not stored on the server. A hash of the key is
    calculated and used to index the key in the server tree of the keys
    (see [VOS Key Array Stores](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/release/2.2/src/vos/README.md#key-array-stores)).
    It is also expected that keys are stored only in Storage Class Memory which
    has reliable data integrity protection.

### Values
On an update, the client will calculate a checksum for the data of the value and
will send it to the server within the RPC. If "server verify" is enabled, the
server will calculate a new checksum for the value and compare with the checksum
received from the client to verify the integrity of the value. If the checksums
don't match, then data corruption has occurred and an error is returned to the
client indicating that the client should try the update again. Whether "server
verify" is enabled or not, the server will store the checksum.
See [VOS](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/release/2.2/src/vos/README.md)
for more info about checksum management and storage in VOS.

On a fetch, the server will return the stored checksum to the client with the
values fetched so the client can verify the values received. If the checksums
don't match, then the client will fetch from another replica if available in
an attempt to get uncorrupted data.

There are some slight variations to this approach for the two different types
of values. The following diagram illustrates a basic example.
 (See [Storage Model](storage.md) for more details about the single value
 and array value types)

![Basic Checksum Flow](../graph/data_integrity/basic_checksum_flow.png)

#### Single Value
A Single Value is an atomic value, meaning that writes to a single value will
update the entire value and reads retrieve the entire value. Other DAOS features
such as Erasure Codes might split a Single Value into multiple shards to be
distributed among multiple storage nodes. Either the whole Single Value (if
going to a single node) or each shard (if distributed) will have a checksum
calculated, sent to the server, and stored on the server.

Note that it is possible for a single value, or shard of a single value, to
be smaller than the checksum derived from it. It is advised that if an
application needs many small single values to use an Array Type instead.

#### Array Values
Unlike Single Values, Array Values can be updated and fetched at any part of
an array. In addition, updates to an array are versioned, so a fetch can include
parts from multiple versions of the array. Each of these versioned parts of an
array are called extents. The following diagrams illustrate a couple examples
(also see [VOS Key Array Stores](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/release/2.2/src/vos/README.md#key-array-stores) for
more information):


A single extent update (blue line) from index 2-13. A fetched extent (orange
line) from index 2-6. The fetch is only part of the original extent written.

![](../graph/data_integrity/array_example_1.png)


Many extent updates and different epochs. A fetch from index 2-13 requires parts
from each extent.

![Array Example 2](../graph/data_integrity/array_example_2.png)


The nature of the array type requires that a more sophisticated approach to
creating checksums is used. DAOS uses a "chunking" approach where each extent
will be broken up into "chunks" with a predetermined "chunk size." Checksums
will be derived from these chunks. Chunks are aligned with an absolute offset
(starting at 0), not an I/O offset. The following diagram illustrates a chunk
size configured to be 4 (units is arbitrary in this example). Though not all
chunks have a full size of 4, an  absolute offset alignment is maintained.
The gray boxes around the extents represent the chunks.

(
See [Object Layer](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/release/2.2/src/object/README.md)
for more details about the checksum process on object update and fetch)

## Checksum calculations
The actual checksum calculations are done by the
 [isa-l](https://github.com/intel/isa-l)
and [isa-l_crypto](https://github.com/intel/isa-l_crypto) libraries. However,
these libraries are abstracted away from much of DAOS and a common checksum
library is used with appropriate adapters to the actual isa-l implementations.

## Performance Impact
Calculating checksums can be CPU intensive and will impact performance. To
 mitigate performance impact, checksum types with hardware acceleration should
 be chosen. For example, CRC32C is supported by recent Intel CPUs, and many are
 accelerated via SIMD.

## Quality
Unit and functional testing is performed at many layers.
