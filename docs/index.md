# Welcome to DAOS Version 2.0!

The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open-source
object store designed from the ground up for massively distributed Non
Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage of next-generation NVM
technology, like Intel<sup>&copy;</sup> Optane<sup>&trade;</sup>
Persistent Memory and NVM express (NVMe),
while presenting a key-value storage interface on top of commodity
hardware that provides features, such as transactional non-blocking
I/O, advanced data protection with self-healing, end-to-end data
integrity, fine-grained data control, and elastic storage, to optimize
performance and cost.

The included document versions are associated with DAOS v2.0.
They may also describe features that are currently under development
for a future DAOS release. Those features will be clearly marked as such.
