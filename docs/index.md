# Welcome to DAOS Version 2.5!

The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open-source
object store designed from the ground up for massively distributed Non
Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage of next-generation NVM
technology, like Intel<sup>&copy;</sup> Optane<sup>&trade;</sup>
Persistent Memory and NVM express (NVMe),
while presenting a key-value storage interface on top of commodity
hardware that provides features, such as transactional non-blocking
I/O, advanced data protection with self-healing, end-to-end data
integrity, fine-grained data control, and elastic storage, to optimize
performance and cost.

In addition to on-prem deployments, DAOS can be deployed in cloud
environments. More information on cloud deployments is available
in the [DAOS in the Cloud](./cloud/) section.

The included document versions are associated with DAOS v2.5.
They may also describe features that are currently under development
for a future DAOS release. Those features will be clearly marked as such.

!!! warning
    DAOS v2.5 is the (unstable) master branch for DAOS v2.6 development.
    Use at your own risk. Please consider the [latest](../latest/)
    stable DAOS release for production deployments.
