# Welcome to DAOS!

The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open-source
object store designed from the ground up for massively distributed Non
Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage of next-generation NVM
technology, like Intel<sup>&copy;</sup> Optane<sup>&trade;</sup>
Persistent Memory and NVM express (NVMe),
while presenting a key-value storage interface on top of commodity
hardware that provides features, such as transactional non-blocking
I/O, advanced data protection with self-healing, end-to-end data
integrity, fine-grained data control, and elastic storage, to optimize
performance and cost.

In addition to on-prem deployments, DAOS can be deployed in cloud
environments. More information on cloud deployments is available
in the [DAOS in the Cloud](./cloud/) section.

The included document versions are associated with DAOS v2.2.
They may also describe features that are currently under development
for a future DAOS release. Those features will be clearly marked as such.
