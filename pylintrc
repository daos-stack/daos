# Requirements for pylint checking in DAOS.

# Wrapper script for pylint that does the following:
# Mostly working:
#  Wraps scons commands and adjusts report line numbers
#  Sets python-path or similar
#  Runs in parallel across whole tree
#  Supports minimum python version
#  Supports venv
#  Can be used by atom.io live
#  Outputs directly to github annotations
# In progress:
#  Can be used in Jenkins to report regressions
#  Can be used as a commit-hook
#  flake8 style --diff option
#  Autodetect if spelling is going to work.

# Modes:
# Jenkins:
#  Runs against whole tree, produces warnings-ng style output for everything, and Jenkins warns
#   on regressions.
# GHA:
#  Runs against whole tree with some warnings.
# Commit-hook:
#  Runs against whole tree with some warnings, and against diff with others.
# Editor:
#  Runs against single-file, but restricted in output format.
# Direct:
