Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is utils/docker/images/README.

Dockerfiles and scripts placed in this directory are intended to be used as
development process vehicles and part of continuous integration process.

Images built out of those recipes may by used with Docker or podman as
development environment.

To manually build docker image using docker(1) execute, e.g.:

docker build --build-arg https_proxy=http://proxy.com:port --build-arg http_proxy=http://proxy.com:port \
    -t pmdk:debian-unstable -f ./Dockerfile.ubuntu-22.04 .

To run build and tests within a (previously built) Docker container execute, e.g.:

docker run --network=bridge --shm-size=4G -v /your/workspace/path/:/opt/workspace:z -w /opt/workspace/ \
    -e PMDK_CC=gcc -it pmdk:ubuntu-22.04 /bin/bash
