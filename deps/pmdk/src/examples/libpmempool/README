Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is examples/libpmempool/README.

This directory contains examples for libpmempool, the library providing
support for off-line pool management, diagnostics and repair.
Some of these examples are explained in more detail
here: https://pmem.io/pmdk/libpmempool

manpage.c is the example used in the libpmempool man page.

To build these examples:
	make

These examples can be built against an installed system using:
	make LIBDIR=/usr/lib INCDIR=/usr/include

If you're looking for documentation to get you started using PMDK,
start here: https://pmem.io/pmdk and follow the links to examples and
man pages.  Developers new to PMDK are probably looking for libpmemobj.
