Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is examples/libpmem/README.

This directory contains examples for libpmem, the library containing
low-level persistent memory support.  A detailed explanation of these
examples can be found here: https://pmem.io/pmdk/libpmem

manpage.c is the example used in the libpmem man page.

simple_copy.c is a simple pmem_memcpy() example.

full_copy.c shows how to use pmem_memcpy_nodrain().

To build these examples:
	make

These examples can be built against an installed system using:
	make LIBDIR=/usr/lib INCDIR=/usr/include

If you're looking for documentation to get you started using PMDK,
start here: https://pmem.io/pmdk and follow the links to examples and
man pages.  Developers new to PMDK are probably looking for libpmemobj.
