Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/tools/gran_detecto/README.

Long-time ago in the Wild West, cowboys solved their problems using revolvers.
So far, pmemdetect efficiently defended PMDK users from persistency robbers,
but newcomers: ADR and eADR beat him. Luckily, gran_detecto enters the game.
This 'grande' tool detects supported granularity by given 'path' argument.
For example, if we want to check if cache line granularity is available we
should use gran_detecto as follow: gran_detecto -p /mnt/pmem.

It's used as a 'smoke test' before running the tests.

Usage:
	$ gran_detecto -h
	$ gran_detecto <-b|-c|-d|-p> <path>

Available options:
 -b, --byte          - check if <path> has byte granularity
 -c, --cache-line    - check if <path> has cache line granularity
 -d, --detect        - detect the smallest available granularity for <path>
 -p, --page          - check if <path> has page granularity
 -h, --help          - print this usage info
