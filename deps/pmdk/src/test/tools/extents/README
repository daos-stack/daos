This is src/test/tools/extents/README.

This directory contains a tool for listing physical extents of a file.

Usage:
	$ extents [-l <logical_offset>] <file>

If no '<logical_offset>' is given, than the output of this command
is a simple list of pairs: physical offset and length - both of them
expressed in 512B sectors (offset from the beginning of the device).

If a '<logical_offset>' is given, than the output of this command
is the physical offset of the given logical one.
