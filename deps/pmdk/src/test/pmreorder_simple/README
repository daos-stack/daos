This is src/test/pmreorder_simple/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmreorder script.

SYNOPSIS:
pmreorder_simple g|b|c|m file

DESCRIPTION:
pmreorder_simple is the unit test for verifying the functionality of
pmreorder script.

OPTIONS:
	file is '$DIR/testfile' for all tests.
	b: write data to the pool in an inconsistent way
	g: write data to the pool in a consistent way
	m: write data to the pool in a consistent way,
		but at the beginning logs some inconsistent values
	c: check pool consistency

The pool contains three int fields and a "written" flag. If the flag is set, all
three fields have to have the same value to be consistent. When ran with 'b' all
fields are written at the same time, with respect to the persistence barrier.
When run with 'g' the three ints are written first and the flag is written last.
The consistency check returns non-zero if the flag is set and the ints differ.
