Updating the driver
===================

NOTE:
- To avoid namespace issues with e1000 PMD, all prefix e1000_ or E1000_
of the definition, macro and file names ware replaced with igc_ or IGC_.
- Since some codes are not required, they have been removed from the
base codes, such as the I350 and I210 series NICs related codes.
- Some registers are used by the base codes but not defined in the base
codes, so they ware added to them.
- OS and DPDK specified definitions and macros ware added in following
files:
  igc_osdep.h
  igc_osdep.c
