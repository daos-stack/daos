ARMv8 Crypto Poll Mode Driver
=============================

This code provides the initial implementation of the ARMv8 crypto PMD.
The driver uses ARMv8 cryptographic extensions to process chained crypto
operations in an optimized way. The core functionality is provided by
a low-level library, written in the assembly code.

Features
--------

ARMv8 Crypto PMD has support for the following algorithm pairs:

Supported cipher algorithms:

* ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_AES_CBC``

Supported authentication algorithms:

* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA1_HMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA256_HMAC``

Installation
------------

To build DPDK with this virtual crypto PMD, the user is required to:

* Download AArch64 crypto library source code from
  `here <https://github.com/ARM-software/AArch64cryptolib>`_.

* Build the ``AArch64cryptolib`` library:

.. code-block:: console

   make

* Add path to `libAArch64crypto.pc` in `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable:

.. code-block:: console

   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path_to_AArch64cryptolib>/pkgconfig/:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

* Build DPDK:

.. code-block:: console

   meson build
   ninja -C build

The corresponding device can be created only if the following features
are supported by the CPU:

* ``RTE_CPUFLAG_AES``
* ``RTE_CPUFLAG_SHA1``
* ``RTE_CPUFLAG_SHA2``
* ``RTE_CPUFLAG_NEON``

Initialization
--------------

Use ``--vdev "crypto_armv8"`` in the EAL options to create virtual crypto device.

User can use app/test application to check how to use this PMD and to verify
crypto processing.

Test name is cryptodev_sw_armv8_autotest.

Limitations
-----------

* Maximum number of sessions is 2048.
* Only chained operations are supported.
* AES-128-CBC is the only supported cipher variant.
* Cipher input data has to be a multiple of 16 bytes.
* Digest input data has to be a multiple of 8 bytes.
