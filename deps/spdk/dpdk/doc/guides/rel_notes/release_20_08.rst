DPDK Release 20.08
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added non-EAL threads registration API.**

  Added a new API to register non-EAL threads as lcores. This can be used by
  applications to have its threads known to DPDK without suffering from the
  non-EAL previous limitations in terms of performance.

* **rte_*mb APIs are updated to use the DMB instruction for ARMv8.**

  ARMv8 memory model has been strengthened to require other-multi-copy
  atomicity. This allows for using the DMB instruction instead of DSB for IO
  barriers. The rte_*mb APIs, for ARMv8 platforms, have changed to use the DMB
  instruction to reflect this.

* **Added support for RTS and HTS modes into mempool ring driver.**

  Added the ability to select new ring synchronisation modes:
  ``relaxed tail sync (ring_mt_rts)`` and ``head/tail sync (ring_mt_hts)``
  via the mempool ops API.

* **Added the support for vfio-pci new VF token interface.**

  From Linux 5.7, vfio-pci supports to bind both SR-IOV PF and the created
  VFs, where it uses a shared VF token (UUID) to represent the collaboration
  between PF and VFs. The DPDK PCI driver has been updated to gain the access
  to the PF and VFs devices by appending the VF token parameter.

* **Added the RegEx Library, a generic RegEx service library.**

  Added the RegEx library which provides an API for offload of regular
  expressions search operations to hardware or software accelerator devices.

  Added Mellanox RegEx PMD, allowing to offload RegEx searches.

* **Added vhost async data path APIs.**

  4 new APIs have been added to enable vhost async data path, including:

  * Async device channel register/unregister APIs.
  * Async packets enqueue/completion APIs (only split ring was implemented).

* **Added vDPA device APIs to query virtio queue statistics.**

  Added new vDPA APIs to query virtio queue statistics, to get their names and
  to reset them.

  5G network.

* **Introduced send packet scheduling based on timestamps.**

  Added a new mbuf dynamic field and flag to provide a timestamp on which
  packet transmitting can be synchronized. A device Tx offload flag has been
  added to indicate the PMD supports send scheduling.
