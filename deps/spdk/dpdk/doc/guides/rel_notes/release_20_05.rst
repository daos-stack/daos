DPDK Release 20.05
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added Trace Library and Tracepoints.**

  Added a native implementation of the "common trace format" (CTF) based trace
  library. This allows the user add tracepoints in an application/library to
  get runtime trace/debug information for control, and fast APIs with minimum
  impact on fast path performance. Typical trace overhead is ~20 cycles and
  instrumentation overhead is 1 cycle.  Added tracepoints in ``EAL``,
  ``ethdev``, ``cryptodev``, ``eventdev`` and ``mempool`` libraries for
  important functions.

* **Added APIs for RCU defer queues.**

  Added APIs to create and delete defer queues. Additional APIs are provided
  to enqueue a deleted resource and reclaim the resource in the future.
  These APIs help an application use lock-free data structures with
  less effort.

* **Added new API for rte_ring.**

  * Introduced new synchronization modes for ``rte_ring``.

    Introduced new optional MT synchronization modes for ``rte_ring``:
    Relaxed Tail Sync (RTS) mode and Head/Tail Sync (HTS) mode.
    With these modes selected, ``rte_ring`` shows significant improvements for
    average enqueue/dequeue times on overcommitted systems.

  * Added peek style API for ``rte_ring``.

    For rings with producer/consumer in ``RTE_RING_SYNC_ST``, ``RTE_RING_SYNC_MT_HTS``
    mode, provide the ability to split enqueue/dequeue operation into two phases
    (enqueue/dequeue start and enqueue/dequeue finish). This allows the user to inspect
    objects in the ring without removing them (aka MT safe peek).

* **Added flow aging support.**

  Added flow aging support to detect and report aged-out flows, including:

  * Added new action: ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_AGE`` to set the timeout
    and the application flow context for each flow.
  * Added new event: ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_FLOW_AGED`` for the driver to report
    that there are new aged-out flows.
  * Added new query: ``rte_flow_get_aged_flows`` to get the aged-out flows
    contexts from the port.

* **ethdev: Added a new value to link speed for 200Gbps.**

  Added a new ethdev value to for link speeds of 200Gbps.

* **Updated the Amazon ena driver.**

* **Updated the ZUC crypto PMD.**

  * Added support for intel-ipsec-mb version 0.54.
  * Updated the PMD to support Multi-buffer ZUC-EIA3,
    improving performance significantly, when using
    intel-ipsec-mb version 0.54

* **Updated the SNOW3G crypto PMD.**

  Added support for intel-ipsec-mb version 0.54.

* **Updated the KASUMI crypto PMD.**

  Added support for intel-ipsec-mb version 0.54.

* **Updated the QuickAssist Technology (QAT) Crypto PMD.**

  * Added handling of mixed crypto algorithms in QAT PMD for GEN2.

    Enabled handling of mixed algorithms in encrypted digest hash-cipher
    (generation) and cipher-hash (verification) requests in QAT PMD when
    running on GEN2 QAT hardware with particular firmware versions (GEN3
    support was added in DPDK 20.02).

  * Added plain SHA-1, 224, 256, 384, 512 support to QAT PMD.

    Added support for plain SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512
    hashes to QAT PMD.

  * Added AES-GCM/GMAC J0 support to QAT PMD.

    Added support for AES-GCM/GMAC J0 to Intel QuickAssist Technology PMD. The
    user can use this feature by passing a zero length IV in the appropriate
    xform. For more information refer to the doxygen comments in
    ``rte_crypto_sym.h`` for ``J0``.

  * Updated the QAT PMD for AES-256 DOCSIS.

    Added AES-256 DOCSIS algorithm support to the QAT PMD.

* **Updated the QuickAssist Technology (QAT) Compression PMD.**

  Added special buffer handling when the internal QAT intermediate buffer is
  too small for the Huffman dynamic compression operation. Instead of falling
  back to fixed compression, the operation is now split into multiple smaller
  dynamic compression requests (which are possible to execute on QAT) and
  their results are then combined and copied into the output buffer. This is
  not possible if any checksum calculation was requested - in such cases the
  code falls back to fixed compression as before.

* **Updated the turbo_sw bbdev PMD.**

  Added support for large size code blocks which do not fit in one mbuf
  segment.

* **Added Intel FPGA_5GNR_FEC bbdev PMD.**

  Added a new ``fpga_5gnr_fec`` bbdev driver for the Intel\ |reg| FPGA PAC
  (Programmable  Acceleration Card) N3000.  See the
  :doc:`../bbdevs/fpga_5gnr_fec` BBDEV guide for more details on this new driver.

* **Updated the DSW event device.**

  Updated the DSW PMD with new features and improvements, including:

  * Improved flow migration mechanism, allowing faster and more
    accurate load balancing.
  * Improved behavior on high-core count systems.
  * Reduced latency in low-load situations.
  * Extended DSW xstats with migration and load-related statistics.

* **Updated ipsec-secgw sample application.**

  Updated the ``ipsec-secgw`` sample application with the following features:

  * Updated the application to add event based packet processing. The worker
    thread(s) would receive events and submit them back to the event device
    after the processing. This way, multicore scaling and HW assisted
    scheduling is achieved by making use of the event device capabilities. The
    event mode currently only supports inline IPsec protocol offload.

  * Updated the application to support key sizes for AES-192-CBC, AES-192-GCM,
    AES-256-GCM algorithms.

  * Added IPsec inbound load-distribution support for the application using
    NIC load distribution feature (Flow Director).

* **Updated Telemetry Library.**

  The updated Telemetry library has been significantly improved in relation to
  the original version to make it more accessible and scalable:

  * It now enables DPDK libraries and applications to provide their own
    specific telemetry information, rather than being limited to what could be
    reported through the metrics library.

  * It is no longer dependent on the external Jansson library, which allows
    Telemetry be enabled by default.

  * The socket handling has been simplified making it easier for clients to
    connect and retrieve information.

* **Added the rte_graph library.**

  The Graph architecture abstracts the data processing functions as ``nodes``
  and ``links`` them together to create a complex ``graph`` to enable
  reusable/modular data processing functions. The graph library provides APIs
  to enable graph framework operations such as create, lookup, dump and
  destroy on graph and node operations such as clone, edge update, and edge
  shrink, etc. The API also allows the creation of a stats cluster to monitor
  per graph and per node statistics.

* **Added the rte_node library.**

  Added the ``rte_node`` library that consists of nodes used by the
  ``rte_graph`` library. Each node performs a specific packet processing
  function based on the application configuration.

  The following nodes are added:

  * Null node: A skeleton node that defines the general structure of a node.
  * Ethernet device node: Consists of Ethernet Rx/Tx nodes as well as Ethernet
    control APIs.
  * IPv4 lookup node: Consists of IPv4 extract and LPM lookup node. Routes can
    be configured by the application through the ``rte_node_ip4_route_add``
    function.
  * IPv4 rewrite node: Consists of IPv4 and Ethernet header rewrite
    functionality that can be configured through the
    ``rte_node_ip4_rewrite_add`` function.
  * Packet drop node: Frees the packets received to their respective mempool.

* **Added new l3fwd-graph sample application.**

  Added an example application ``l3fwd-graph``. This demonstrates the usage of
  the graph library and node library for packet processing. In addition to the
  library usage demonstration, this application can be used for performance
  comparison of the existing ``l3fwd`` (static code without any nodes) with
  the modular ``l3fwd-graph`` approach.

* **Updated the testpmd application.**

  Added a new cmdline option ``--rx-mq-mode`` which can be used to test PMD's
  behaviour on handling Rx mq mode.

* **Added support for GCC 10.**

  Added support for building with GCC 10.1.


API Changes
-----------

* mempool: The API of ``rte_mempool_populate_iova()`` and
  ``rte_mempool_populate_virt()`` changed to return 0 instead of ``-EINVAL``
  when there is not enough room to store one object.


ABI Changes
-----------

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with DPDK 20.02 and 19.11.
