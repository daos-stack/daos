    action handle creation, update for conntrack action as well as conntrack
    item matching.
  * Added commands for action meter color to color the packet to reflect
    the meter color result:
    ``color type (green|yellow|red)``.

* **Added support for the FIB lookup method in the l3fwd example app.**

  Added support to the l3fwd application to support
  the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) lookup method.
  Previously l3fwd only supported the LPM and Exact Match lookup methods.

* **Updated the ipsec-secgw sample application.**

  * Updated the ``ipsec-secgw`` sample application with UDP encapsulation
    support for NAT Traversal.

* **Added sub-testsuite support.**

  * The unit test suite struct now supports having both a nested
    list of sub-testsuites, and a list of testcases as before.


Removed Items
-------------

* Removed support for Intel DLB V1 hardware. This is not a broad market device,
  and existing customers already obtain the source code directly from Intel.


API Changes
-----------

* eal: The experimental TLS API added in ``rte_thread.h`` has been renamed
  from ``rte_thread_tls_*`` to ``rte_thread_*`` to avoid naming redundancy
  and confusion with the transport layer security term.

* pci: The value ``PCI_ANY_ID`` is marked as deprecated
  and can be replaced with ``RTE_PCI_ANY_ID``.

* ethdev: Added a ``rte_flow`` pointer parameter to the function
  ``rte_flow_dev_dump()`` allowing dumping of a single flow.

* cryptodev: The experimental raw data path API for dequeue
  ``rte_cryptodev_raw_dequeue_burst`` got a new parameter
  ``max_nb_to_dequeue`` to provide flexible control on dequeue.

* ethdev: The experimental flow API for shared action has been generalized
  as a flow action handle used in rules through an indirect action.
  The functions ``rte_flow_shared_action_*`` manipulating the action object
  are replaced with ``rte_flow_action_handle_*``.
  The action ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SHARED`` is deprecated and can be
  replaced with ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_INDIRECT``.

* ethdev: The experimental function ``rte_mtr_policer_actions_update()``,
  the enum ``rte_mtr_policer_action``, and the struct members
  ``policer_action_recolor_supported`` and ``policer_action_drop_supported``
  have been removed.

* vhost: The vhost library currently populates received mbufs from a virtio
  driver with Tx offload flags while not filling Rx offload flags.
  While this behavior is arguable, it is kept untouched.
  A new flag ``RTE_VHOST_USER_NET_COMPLIANT_OL_FLAGS`` has been added to ask
  for a behavior compliant with the mbuf offload API.

* stack: Lock-free ``rte_stack`` no longer silently ignores push and pop when
  it's not supported on the current platform. Instead ``rte_stack_create()``
  fails and ``rte_errno`` is set to ``ENOTSUP``.

* raw/ioat: The experimental function ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()`` now
  supports two additional parameters, ``status`` and ``num_unsuccessful``,
  to allow the reporting of errors from hardware when performing copy
  operations.


ABI Changes
-----------

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with 20.11.

* The experimental function ``rte_telemetry_legacy_register`` has been
  removed from the public API and is now an internal-only function. This
  function was already marked as internal in the API documentation for it,
  and was not for use by external applications.
