vfio-user Protocol Specification

Version_ 0.9.1

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============
vfio-user is a protocol that allows a device to be emulated in a separate
process outside of a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). vfio-user devices consist
of a generic VFIO device type, living inside the VMM, which we call the client,
and the core device implementation, living outside the VMM, which we call the
server.

The vfio-user specification is partly based on the
`Linux VFIO ioctl interface <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio.html>`_.

VFIO is a mature and stable API, backed by an extensively used framework. The
existing VFIO client implementation in QEMU (``qemu/hw/vfio/``) can be largely
re-used, though there is nothing in this specification that requires that
particular implementation. None of the VFIO kernel modules are required for
supporting the protocol, on either the client or server side. Some source
definitions in VFIO are re-used for vfio-user.

The main idea is to allow a virtual device to function in a separate process in
the same host over a UNIX domain socket. A UNIX domain socket (``AF_UNIX``) is
chosen because file descriptors can be trivially sent over it, which in turn
allows:

* Sharing of client memory for DMA with the server.
* Sharing of server memory with the client for fast MMIO.
* Efficient sharing of eventfd's for triggering interrupts.

Other socket types could be used which allow the server to run in a separate
guest in the same host (``AF_VSOCK``) or remotely (``AF_INET``). Theoretically
the underlying transport does not necessarily have to be a socket, however we do
not examine such alternatives. In this protocol version we focus on using a UNIX
domain socket and introduce basic support for the other two types of sockets
without considering performance implications.

While passing of file descriptors is desirable for performance reasons, support
is not necessary for either the client or the server in order to implement the
protocol. There is always an in-band, message-passing fall back mechanism.

Overview
========

VFIO is a framework that allows a physical device to be securely passed through
to a user space process; the device-specific kernel driver does not drive the
device at all.  Typically, the user space process is a VMM and the device is
passed through to it in order to achieve high performance. VFIO provides an API
and the required functionality in the kernel. QEMU has adopted VFIO to allow a
guest to directly access physical devices, instead of emulating them in
software.

vfio-user reuses the core VFIO concepts defined in its API, but implements them
as messages to be sent over a socket. It does not change the kernel-based VFIO
in any way, in fact none of the VFIO kernel modules need to be loaded to use
vfio-user. It is also possible for the client to concurrently use the current
kernel-based VFIO for one device, and vfio-user for another device.

VFIO Device Model
-----------------

A device under VFIO presents a standard interface to the user process. Many of
the VFIO operations in the existing interface use the ``ioctl()`` system call, and
references to the existing interface are called the ``ioctl()`` implementation in
this document.

The following sections describe the set of messages that implement the vfio-user
interface over a socket. In many cases, the messages are analogous to data
structures used in the ``ioctl()`` implementation. Messages derived from the
``ioctl()`` will have a name derived from the ``ioctl()`` command name.  E.g., the
``VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` ``ioctl()`` command becomes a
``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` message.  The purpose of this reuse is to share as
much code as feasible with the ``ioctl()`` implementation``.

Connection Initiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the client connects to the server, the initial client message is
``VFIO_USER_VERSION`` to propose a protocol version and set of capabilities to
apply to the session. The server replies with a compatible version and set of
capabilities it supports, or closes the connection if it cannot support the
advertised version.

Device Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client uses a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` message to query the server for
information about the device. This information includes:

* The device type and whether it supports reset (``VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_``),
* the number of device regions, and
* the device presents to the client the number of interrupt types the device
  supports.

Region Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client uses ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_INFO`` messages to query the
server for information about the device's regions. This information describes:

* Read and write permissions, whether it can be memory mapped, and whether it
  supports additional capabilities (``VFIO_REGION_INFO_CAP_``).
* Region index, size, and offset.

When a device region can be mapped by the client, the server provides a file
descriptor which the client can ``mmap()``. The server is responsible for
polling for client updates to memory mapped regions.

Region Capabilities
"""""""""""""""""""

Some regions have additional capabilities that cannot be described adequately
by the region info data structure. These capabilities are returned in the
region info reply in a list similar to PCI capabilities in a PCI device's
configuration space.

Sparse Regions
""""""""""""""
A region can be memory-mappable in whole or in part. When only a subset of a
region can be mapped by the client, a ``VFIO_REGION_INFO_CAP_SPARSE_MMAP``
capability is included in the region info reply. This capability describes
which portions can be mapped by the client.

.. Note::
   For example, in a virtual NVMe controller, sparse regions can be used so
   that accesses to the NVMe registers (found in the beginning of BAR0) are
   trapped (an infrequent event), while allowing direct access to the doorbells
   (an extremely frequent event as every I/O submission requires a write to
   BAR0), found in the next page after the NVMe registers in BAR0.

Device-Specific Regions
"""""""""""""""""""""""

A device can define regions additional to the standard ones (e.g. PCI indexes
0-8). This is achieved by including a ``VFIO_REGION_INFO_CAP_TYPE`` capability
in the region info reply of a device-specific region. Such regions are reflected
in ``struct vfio_user_device_info.num_regions``. Thus, for PCI devices this
value can be equal to, or higher than, ``VFIO_PCI_NUM_REGIONS``.

Region I/O via file descriptors
-------------------------------

For unmapped regions, region I/O from the client is done via
``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ/WRITE``.  As an optimization, ioeventfds or ioregionfds
may be configured for sub-regions of some regions. A client may request
information on these sub-regions via ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_IO_FDS``; by
configuring the returned file descriptors as ioeventfds or ioregionfds, the
server can be directly notified of I/O (for example, by KVM) without taking a
trip through the client.

Interrupts
^^^^^^^^^^

The client uses ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_IRQ_INFO`` messages to query the server
for the device's interrupt types. The interrupt types are specific to the bus
the device is attached to, and the client is expected to know the capabilities
of each interrupt type. The server can signal an interrupt by directly injecting
interrupts into the guest via an event file descriptor. The client configures
how the server signals an interrupt with ``VFIO_USER_SET_IRQS`` messages.

Device Read and Write
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the guest executes load or store operations to an unmapped device region,
the client forwards these operations to the server with
``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ`` or ``VFIO_USER_REGION_WRITE`` messages. The server
will reply with data from the device on read operations or an acknowledgement on
write operations. See `Read and Write Operations`_.

Client memory access
--------------------

The client uses ``VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP`` and ``VFIO_USER_DMA_UNMAP`` messages to
inform the server of the valid DMA ranges that the server can access on behalf
of a device (typically, VM guest memory). DMA memory may be accessed by the
server via ``VFIO_USER_DMA_READ`` and ``VFIO_USER_DMA_WRITE`` messages over the
socket. In this case, the "DMA" part of the naming is a misnomer.

Actual direct memory access of client memory from the server is possible if the
client provides file descriptors the server can ``mmap()``. Note that ``mmap()``
privileges cannot be revoked by the client, therefore file descriptors should
only be exported in environments where the client trusts the server not to
corrupt guest memory.

See `Read and Write Operations`_.

Client/server interactions
==========================

Socket
------

A server can serve:

1) one or more clients, and/or
2) one or more virtual devices, belonging to one or more clients.

The current protocol specification requires a dedicated socket per
client/server connection. It is a server-side implementation detail whether a
single server handles multiple virtual devices from the same or multiple
clients. The location of the socket is implementation-specific. Multiplexing
clients, devices, and servers over the same socket is not supported in this
version of the protocol.

Authentication
--------------

For ``AF_UNIX``, we rely on OS mandatory access controls on the socket files,
therefore it is up to the management layer to set up the socket as required.
Socket types that span guests or hosts will require a proper authentication
mechanism. Defining that mechanism is deferred to a future version of the
protocol.

Command Concurrency
-------------------

A client may pipeline multiple commands without waiting for previous command
replies.  The server will process commands in the order they are received.  A
consequence of this is if a client issues a command with the *No_reply* bit,
then subsequently issues a command without *No_reply*, the older command will
have been processed before the reply to the younger command is sent by the
server.  The client must be aware of the device's capability to process
concurrent commands if pipelining is used.  For example, pipelining allows
multiple client threads to concurrently access device regions; the client must
ensure these accesses obey device semantics.

An example is a frame buffer device, where the device may allow concurrent
access to different areas of video memory, but may have indeterminate behavior
if concurrent accesses are performed to command or status registers.

Note that unrelated messages sent from the server to the client can appear in
between a client to server request/reply and vice versa.

Implementers should be prepared for certain commands to exhibit potentially
unbounded latencies.  For example, ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_RESET`` may take an
arbitrarily long time to complete; clients should take care not to block
unnecessarily.

Socket Disconnection Behavior
-----------------------------
The server and the client can disconnect from each other, either intentionally
or unexpectedly. Both the client and the server need to know how to handle such
events.

Server Disconnection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A server disconnecting from the client may indicate that:

1) A virtual device has been restarted, either intentionally (e.g. because of a
   device update) or unintentionally (e.g. because of a crash).
2) A virtual device has been shut down with no intention to be restarted.

It is impossible for the client to know whether or not a failure is
intermittent or innocuous and should be retried, therefore the client should
reset the VFIO device when it detects the socket has been disconnected.
Error recovery will be driven by the guest's device error handling
behavior.

Client Disconnection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The client disconnecting from the server primarily means that the client
has exited. Currently, this means that the guest is shut down so the device is
no longer needed therefore the server can automatically exit. However, there
can be cases where a client disconnection should not result in a server exit:

1) A single server serving multiple clients.
2) A multi-process QEMU upgrading itself step by step, which is not yet
   implemented.

Therefore in order for the protocol to be forward compatible, the server should
respond to a client disconnection as follows:

 - all client memory regions are unmapped and cleaned up (including closing any
   passed file descriptors)
 - all IRQ file descriptors passed from the old client are closed
 - the device state should otherwise be retained

The expectation is that when a client reconnects, it will re-establish IRQ and
client memory mappings.

If anything happens to the client (such as qemu really did exit), the control
stack will know about it and can clean up resources accordingly.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Speaking generally, vfio-user clients should not trust servers, and vice versa.
Standard tools and mechanisms should be used on both sides to validate input and
prevent against denial of service scenarios, buffer overflow, etc.

Request Retry and Response Timeout
----------------------------------
A failed command is a command that has been successfully sent and has been
responded to with an error code. Failure to send the command in the first place
(e.g. because the socket is disconnected) is a different type of error examined
earlier in the disconnect section.

.. Note::
   QEMU's VFIO retries certain operations if they fail. While this makes sense
   for real HW, we don't know for sure whether it makes sense for virtual
   devices.

Defining a retry and timeout scheme is deferred to a future version of the
protocol.

Message sizes
-------------

Some requests have an ``argsz`` field. In a request, it defines the maximum
expected reply payload size, which should be at least the size of the fixed
reply payload headers defined here. The *request* payload size is defined by the
usual ``msg_size`` field in the header, not the ``argsz`` field.

In a reply, the server sets ``argsz`` field to the size needed for a full
payload size. This may be less than the requested maximum size. This may be
larger than the requested maximum size: in that case, the payload reply header
is returned, but the ``argsz`` field in the reply indicates the needed size,
allowing a client to allocate a larger buffer for holding the reply before
trying again.

In addition, during negotiation (see  `Version`_), the client and server may
each specify a ``max_data_xfer_size`` value; this defines the maximum data that
may be read or written via one of the ``VFIO_USER_DMA/REGION_READ/WRITE``
messages; see `Read and Write Operations`_.

Protocol Specification
======================

To distinguish from the base VFIO symbols, all vfio-user symbols are prefixed
with ``vfio_user`` or ``VFIO_USER``. In this revision, all data is in the
little-endian format, although this may be relaxed in future revisions in cases
where the client and server are both big-endian.

Unless otherwise specified, all sizes should be presumed to be in bytes.

Header
------

All messages, both command messages and reply messages, are preceded by a
16-byte header that contains basic information about the message. The header is
followed by message-specific data described in the sections below.

+----------------+--------+-------------+
| Name           | Offset | Size        |
+================+========+=============+
| Message ID     | 0      | 2           |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
| Command        | 2      | 2           |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
| Message size   | 4      | 4           |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
| Flags          | 8      | 4           |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
|                | +-----+------------+ |
|                | | Bit | Definition | |
|                | +=====+============+ |
|                | | 0-3 | Type       | |
|                | +-----+------------+ |
|                | | 4   | No_reply   | |
|                | +-----+------------+ |
|                | | 5   | Error      | |
|                | +-----+------------+ |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
| Error          | 12     | 4           |
+----------------+--------+-------------+
| <message data> | 16     | variable    |
+----------------+--------+-------------+

* *Message ID* identifies the message, and is echoed in the command's reply
  message. Message IDs belong entirely to the sender, can be re-used (even
  concurrently) and the receiver must not make any assumptions about their
  uniqueness.
* *Command* specifies the command to be executed, listed in Commands_. It is
  also set in the reply header.
* *Message size* contains the size of the entire message, including the header.
* *Flags* contains attributes of the message:

  * The *Type* bits indicate the message type.

    *  *Command* (value 0x0) indicates a command message.
    *  *Reply* (value 0x1) indicates a reply message acknowledging a previous
       command with the same message ID.
  * *No_reply* in a command message indicates that no reply is needed for this
    command.  This is commonly used when multiple commands are sent, and only
    the last needs acknowledgement.
  * *Error* in a reply message indicates the command being acknowledged had
    an error. In this case, the *Error* field will be valid.

* *Error* in a reply message is an optional UNIX errno value. It may be zero
  even if the Error bit is set in Flags. It is reserved in a command message.

Each command message in Commands_ must be replied to with a reply message,
unless the message sets the *No_Reply* bit.  The reply consists of the header
with the *Reply* bit set, plus any additional data.

If an error occurs, the reply message must only include the reply header.

As the header is standard in both requests and replies, it is not included in
the command-specific specifications below; each message definition should be
appended to the standard header, and the offsets are given from the end of the
standard header.

``VFIO_USER_VERSION``
---------------------

.. _Version:

This is the initial message sent by the client after the socket connection is
established; the same format is used for the server's reply.

Upon establishing a connection, the client must send a ``VFIO_USER_VERSION``
message proposing a protocol version and a set of capabilities. The server
compares these with the versions and capabilities it supports and sends a
``VFIO_USER_VERSION`` reply according to the following rules.

* The major version in the reply must be the same as proposed. If the client
  does not support the proposed major, it closes the connection.
* The minor version in the reply must be equal to or less than the minor
  version proposed.
* The capability list must be a subset of those proposed. If the server
  requires a capability the client did not include, it closes the connection.

The protocol major version will only change when incompatible protocol changes
are made, such as changing the message format. The minor version may change
when compatible changes are made, such as adding new messages or capabilities,
Both the client and server must support all minor versions less than the
maximum minor version it supports. E.g., an implementation that supports
version 1.3 must also support 1.0 through 1.2.

When making a change to this specification, the protocol version number must
be included in the form "added in version X.Y"

Reply
^^^^^

The same message format is used in the server's reply with the semantics
described above.

``VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP``
---------------------

This command message is sent by the client to the server to inform it of the
memory regions the server can access. It must be sent before the server can
perform any DMA to the client. It is normally sent directly after the version
handshake is completed, but may also occur when memory is added to the client,
or if the client uses a vIOMMU.

Request
^^^^^^^

The request payload for this message is a structure of the following format:

+-------------+--------+-------------+

+-------------+--------+-------------+
| size        | 24     | 8           |
+-------------+--------+-------------+

* *argsz* is the size of the above structure. Note there is no reply payload,
  so this field differs from other message types.
* *flags* contains the following region attributes:

  * *readable* indicates that the region can be read from.

  * *writeable* indicates that the region can be written to.

* *offset* is the file offset of the region with respect to the associated file
  descriptor, or zero if the region is not mappable
* *address* is the base DMA address of the region.
* *size* is the size of the region.

This structure is 32 bytes in size, so the message size is 16 + 32 bytes.

If the DMA region being added can be directly mapped by the server, a file
descriptor must be sent as part of the message meta-data. The region can be
mapped via the mmap() system call. On ``AF_UNIX`` sockets, the file descriptor
must be passed as ``SCM_RIGHTS`` type ancillary data.  Otherwise, if the DMA
region cannot be directly mapped by the server, no file descriptor must be sent
as part of the message meta-data and the DMA region can be accessed by the
server using ``VFIO_USER_DMA_READ`` and ``VFIO_USER_DMA_WRITE`` messages,
explained in `Read and Write Operations`_. A command to map over an existing
region must be failed by the server with ``EEXIST`` set in error field in the
reply.

Reply
^^^^^

There is no payload in the reply message.

``VFIO_USER_DMA_UNMAP``
-----------------------

This command message is sent by the client to the server to inform it that a
DMA region, previously made available via a ``VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP`` command
message, is no longer available for DMA. It typically occurs when memory is
subtracted from the client or if the client uses a vIOMMU. The DMA region is
described by the following structure:

* *argsz* is the maximum size of the reply payload.
* *flags* contains the following DMA region attributes:

  * *get dirty page bitmap* indicates that a dirty page bitmap must be
    populated before unmapping the DMA region. The client must provide a
    `VFIO Bitmap`_ structure, explained below, immediately following this
    entry.
  * *unmap all regions* indicates to unmap all the regions previously
    mapped via `VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP`. This flag cannot be combined with
    *get dirty page bitmap* and expects *address* and *size* to be 0.

* *address* is the base DMA address of the DMA region.
* *size* is the size of the DMA region.

The address and size of the DMA region being unmapped must match exactly a
previous mapping. The size of request message depends on whether or not the
*get dirty page bitmap* bit is set in Flags:

* If not set, the size of the total request message is: 16 + 24.

* If set, the size of the total request message is: 16 + 24 + 16.

Reply
^^^^^

Upon receiving a ``VFIO_USER_DMA_UNMAP`` command, if the file descriptor is
mapped then the server must release all references to that DMA region before
replying, which potentially includes in-flight DMA transactions.

The server responds with the original DMA entry in the request. If the
*get dirty page bitmap* bit is set in flags in the request, then
the server also includes the `VFIO Bitmap`_ structure sent in the request,
followed by the corresponding dirty page bitmap, where each bit represents
one page of size *pgsize* in `VFIO Bitmap`_ .

The total size of the total reply message is:
16 + 24 + (16 + *size* in `VFIO Bitmap`_ if *get dirty page bitmap* is set).

``VFIO_REGION_TYPE_MIGRATION`` (3) and ``VFIO_REGION_SUBTYPE_MIGRATION`` (1).

``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_IO_FDS``
--------------------------------------

Clients can access regions via ``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ/WRITE`` or, if provided, by
``mmap()`` of a file descriptor provided by the server.

``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_IO_FDS`` provides an alternative access mechanism via
file descriptors. This is an optional feature intended for performance
improvements where an underlying sub-system (such as KVM) supports communication
across such file descriptors to the vfio-user server, without needing to
round-trip through the client.

The server returns an array of sub-regions for the requested region. Each
sub-region describes a span (offset and size) of a region, along with the
requested file descriptor notification mechanism to use.  Each sub-region in the
response message may choose to use a different method, as defined below.  The
two mechanisms supported in this specification are ioeventfds and ioregionfds.

The server in addition returns a file descriptor in the ancillary data; clients
are expected to configure each sub-region's file descriptor with the requested
notification method. For example, a client could configure KVM with the
requested ioeventfd via a ``KVM_IOEVENTFD`` ``ioctl()``.

* *argsz* is the size of the region IO FD info structure plus the

  i * ((argsz - 16) / count). Note that currently this is 40 bytes for both IO
  FD types, but this is not to be relied on. As elsewhere, this indicates the
  full reply payload size needed.
* *flags* must be zero
* *index* is the index of memory region being queried
* *count* is the number of sub-regions in the array
* *sub-regions* is the array of Sub-Region IO FD info structures

The reply message will additionally include at least one file descriptor in the
ancillary data. Note that more than one sub-region may share the same file
descriptor.

Note that it is the client's responsibility to verify the requested values (for
example, that the requested offset does not exceed the region's bounds).

Each sub-region given in the response has one of two possible structures,
depending whether *type* is ``VFIO_USER_IO_FD_TYPE_IOEVENTFD`` (0) or
``VFIO_USER_IO_FD_TYPE_IOREGIONFD`` (1):

* *argsz* is the size required for the full reply payload (16 bytes today)
* *flags* defines IRQ attributes:

  * ``VFIO_IRQ_INFO_EVENTFD`` indicates the IRQ type can support server eventfd
    signalling.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_INFO_MASKABLE`` indicates that the IRQ type supports the ``MASK``
    and ``UNMASK`` actions in a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQS`` message.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_INFO_AUTOMASKED`` indicates the IRQ type masks itself after being
    triggered, and the client must send an ``UNMASK`` action to receive new
    interrupts.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_INFO_NORESIZE`` indicates ``VFIO_USER_SET_IRQS`` operations setup
    interrupts as a set, and new sub-indexes cannot be enabled without disabling
    the entire type.
* index is the index of IRQ type being queried
* count describes the number of interrupts of the queried type.

``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQS``
-----------------------------

This command message is sent by the client to the server to set actions for
device interrupt types. The VFIO IRQ set structure is defined in
``<linux/vfio.h>`` (``struct vfio_irq_set``).

* *argsz* is the size of the VFIO IRQ set request payload, including any *data*
  field. Note there is no reply payload, so this field differs from other
  message types.
* *flags* defines the action performed on the interrupt range. The ``DATA``
  flags describe the data field sent in the message; the ``ACTION`` flags
  describe the action to be performed. The flags are mutually exclusive for
  both sets.

  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` indicates there is no data field in the command.
    The action is performed unconditionally.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` indicates the data field is an array of boolean
    bytes. The action is performed if the corresponding boolean is true.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` indicates an array of event file descriptors
    was sent in the message meta-data. These descriptors will be signalled when
    the action defined by the action flags occurs. In ``AF_UNIX`` sockets, the
    descriptors are sent as ``SCM_RIGHTS`` type ancillary data.
    If no file descriptors are provided, this de-assigns the specified
    previously configured interrupts.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_MASK`` indicates a masking event. It can be used with
    ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` or ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` to mask an interrupt,
    or with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` to generate an event when the guest masks
    the interrupt.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_UNMASK`` indicates an unmasking event. It can be used
    with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` or ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` to unmask an
    interrupt, or with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` to generate an event when the
    guest unmasks the interrupt.
  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TRIGGER`` indicates a triggering event. It can be used
    with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` or ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` to trigger an
    interrupt, or with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` to generate an event when the
    server triggers the interrupt.

* *index* is the index of IRQ type being setup.
* *start* is the start of the sub-index being set.
* *count* describes the number of sub-indexes being set. As a special case, a
  count (and start) of 0, with data flags of ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` disables
  all interrupts of the index.
* *data* is an optional field included when the
  ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` flag is present. It contains an array of booleans
  that specify whether the action is to be performed on the corresponding
  index. It's used when the action is only performed on a subset of the range
  specified.

Not all interrupt types support every combination of data and action flags.
The client must know the capabilities of the device and IRQ index before it
sends a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message.

In typical operation, a specific IRQ may operate as follows:

1. The client sends a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TRIGGER)`` along
   with an eventfd. This associates the IRQ with a particular eventfd on the
   server side.

#. The client may send a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_MASK/UNMASK)`` along
   with another eventfd. This associates the given eventfd with the
   mask/unmask state on the server side.

#. The server may trigger the IRQ by writing 1 to the eventfd.

#. The server may mask/unmask an IRQ which will write 1 to the corresponding
   mask/unmask eventfd, if there is one.

5. A client may trigger a device IRQ itself, by sending a
   ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE/BOOL|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TRIGGER)``.

6. A client may mask or unmask the IRQ, by sending a
   ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE/BOOL|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_MASK/UNMASK)``.

Reply
^^^^^

There is no payload in the reply.

.. _Read and Write Operations:

Note that all of these operations must be supported by the client and/or server,
even if the corresponding memory or device region has been shared as mappable.

The ``count`` field must not exceed the value of ``max_data_xfer_size`` of the
peer, for both reads and writes.

``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ``
-------------------------

If a device region is not mappable, it's not directly accessible by the client
via ``mmap()`` of the underlying file descriptor. In this case, a client can
read from a device region with this message.

``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_RESET``
--------------------------

This command message is sent from the client to the server to reset the device.
Neither the request or reply have a payload.

``VFIO_USER_DIRTY_PAGES``
-------------------------

This command is analogous to ``VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES``. It is sent by the client
to the server in order to control logging of dirty pages, usually during a live
migration.

Dirty page tracking is optional for server implementation; clients should not
rely on it.

* *argsz* is the size of the VFIO dirty bitmap info structure for
  ``START/STOP``; and for ``GET_BITMAP``, the maximum size of the reply payload

* *flags* defines the action to be performed by the server:

  * ``VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_START`` instructs the server to start logging
    pages it dirties. Logging continues until explicitly disabled by
    ``VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_STOP``.

  * ``VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_STOP`` instructs the server to stop logging
    dirty pages.

  * ``VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_GET_BITMAP`` requests the server to return
    the dirty bitmap for a specific IOVA range. The IOVA range is specified by
    a "VFIO Bitmap Range" structure, which must immediately follow this
    "VFIO Dirty Pages" structure. See `VFIO Bitmap Range Format`_.
    This operation is only valid if logging of dirty pages has been previously
    started.

  These flags are mutually exclusive with each other.

This part of the request is analogous to VFIO's ``struct

VFIO Device Migration Info
--------------------------

A device may contain a migration region (of type
``VFIO_REGION_TYPE_MIGRATION``).  The beginning of the region must contain
``struct vfio_device_migration_info``, defined in ``<linux/vfio.h>``. This
subregion is accessed like any other part of a standard vfio-user region
using ``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ``/``VFIO_USER_REGION_WRITE``.

* *device_state* defines the state of the device:

  The client initiates device state transition by writing the intended state.
  The server must respond only after it has successfully transitioned to the new
  state. If an error occurs then the server must respond to the
  ``VFIO_USER_REGION_WRITE`` operation with the Error field set accordingly and
  must remain at the previous state, or in case of internal error it must
  transition to the error state, defined as
  ``VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_V1_RESUMING | VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_V1_SAVING``. The client
  must re-read the device state in order to determine it afresh.

  The following device states are defined:

  +-----------+---------+----------+-----------------------------------+
  | _RESUMING | _SAVING | _RUNNING | Description                       |

  A device is migrated to the destination as follows:

  * The source client transitions the device state from the running state to
    the pre-copy state. This transition is optional for the client but must be
    supported by the server. The source server starts sending device state data
    to the source client through the migration region while the device is
    running.

  * The source client transitions the device state from the running state or the
    pre-copy state to the stop-and-copy state. The source server stops the
    device, saves device state and sends it to the source client through the
    migration region.

  The source client is responsible for sending the migration data to the
  destination client.

  A device is resumed on the destination as follows:

  * The destination client transitions the device state from the running state
    to the resuming state. The destination server uses the device state data
    received through the migration region to resume the device.

  * The destination client provides saved device state to the destination
    server and then transitions the device to back to the running state.

* *reserved* This field is reserved and any access to it must be ignored by the
  server.

* *pending_bytes* Remaining bytes to be migrated by the server. This field is
  read only.

* *data_offset* Offset in the migration region where the client must:

  * read from, during the pre-copy or stop-and-copy state, or

  * write to, during the resuming state.

  This field is read only.

* *data_size* Contains the size, in bytes, of the amount of data copied to:

  * the source migration region by the source server during the pre-copy or
    stop-and copy state, or

  * the destination migration region by the destination client during the
    resuming state.

Device-specific data must be stored at any position after
``struct vfio_device_migration_info``. Note that the migration region can be
memory mappable, even partially. In practise, only the migration data portion
can be memory mapped.

The client processes device state data during the pre-copy and the
stop-and-copy state in the following iterative manner:

  1. The client reads ``pending_bytes`` to mark a new iteration. Repeated reads
     of this field is an idempotent operation. If there are no migration data
     to be consumed then the next step depends on the current device state:

     * pre-copy: the client must try again.

     * stop-and-copy: this procedure can end and the device can now start
       resuming on the destination.

  2. The client reads ``data_offset``; at this point the server must make
     available a portion of migration data at this offset to be read by the
     client, which must happen *before* completing the read operation. The
     amount of data to be read must be stored in the ``data_size`` field, which
     the client reads next.

  3. The client reads ``data_size`` to determine the amount of migration data
     available.

  4. The client reads and processes the migration data.

  5. Go to step 1.

Note that the client can transition the device from the pre-copy state to the
stop-and-copy state at any time; ``pending_bytes`` does not need to become zero.

The client initializes the device state on the destination by setting the
device state in the resuming state and writing the migration data to the
destination migration region at ``data_offset`` offset. The client can write the
source migration data in an iterative manner and the server must consume this
data before completing each write operation, updating the ``data_offset`` field.
The server must apply the source migration data on the device resume state. The
client must write data on the same order and transaction size as read.

If an error occurs then the server must fail the read or write operation. It is
an implementation detail of the client how to handle errors.

Unused VFIO ``ioctl()`` commands
--------------------------------

The following VFIO commands do not have an equivalent vfio-user command:

* ``VFIO_GET_API_VERSION``
* ``VFIO_CHECK_EXTENSION``
* ``VFIO_SET_IOMMU``
* ``VFIO_GROUP_GET_STATUS``
* ``VFIO_GROUP_SET_CONTAINER``
* ``VFIO_GROUP_UNSET_CONTAINER``
* ``VFIO_GROUP_GET_DEVICE_FD``
* ``VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO``

However, once support for live migration for VFIO devices is finalized some
of the above commands may have to be handled by the client in their
corresponding vfio-user form. This will be addressed in a future protocol
version.

VFIO groups and containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current VFIO implementation includes group and container idioms that
describe how a device relates to the host IOMMU. In the vfio-user
implementation, the IOMMU is implemented in SW by the client, and is not
visible to the server. The simplest idea would be that the client put each
device into its own group and container.

Backend Program Conventions
---------------------------

vfio-user backend program conventions are based on the vhost-user ones.

* The backend program must not daemonize itself.
* No assumptions must be made as to what access the backend program has on the
  system.
* File descriptors 0, 1 and 2 must exist, must have regular
  stdin/stdout/stderr semantics, and can be redirected.
* The backend program must honor the SIGTERM signal.
* The backend program must accept the following commands line options:

  * ``--socket-path=PATH``: path to UNIX domain socket,
  * ``--fd=FDNUM``: file descriptor for UNIX domain socket, incompatible with
    ``--socket-path``
* The backend program must be accompanied with a JSON file stored under
  ``/usr/share/vfio-user``.

TODO add schema similar to docs/interop/vhost-user.json.
