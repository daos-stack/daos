.SH NAME
libipsec-mb \- overview of Intel(R) Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPSec library
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Intel Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPsec Library is highly-optimized
software implementations of the core cryptographic processing for IPsec,
which provides industry-leading performance on a range of Intel(R) Processors.
.br
The library offers API crafted for IPsec applications where a network packet
is subject of encryption and integrity operations.
.br
For best processor utilization it uses multi buffer technology for algorithms
that don't allow multi block processing.
.br
See more in the Intel White Paper:
"Fast Multi-buffer IPsec Implementations on Intel Architecture Processors".
Jim Guilford, Sean Gulley, et. al.
.br
The easiest way to find it is to search the Internet for the title.

.SS RECOMMENDATIONS
DES algorithm should be avoided and AES encryption should be used instead.
.br
3DES is a legacy algorithms and AES encryption is recommended to use instead.
.br
HMAC-MD5-96 is a legacy algorithm and HMAC-SHA1 is recommended to use instead.
.br
DES, 3DES and HMAC-MD5-96 are implemented in the library to support legacy applications.
.br
AES-ECB algorithm should be avoided and AES-CBC or AES-CNTR encryption should be used instead.

.SS KEY STORAGE
The library doesn't offer any solution for secure key storage or storage of sensitive information.
It is up to application to arrange safe storage of sensitive information.

.SS API
The library offers four sets of identical API's. Each set corresponds to one architecture: SSE, AVX, AVX2 and AVX512.
.br
It comprises of init_mb_mgr, get_next_job, submit_job, get_completed_job and flush_job operations.
.br
.nf
init_mb_mgr()  \- initializes the instance of the multi-buffer manager
get_next_job() \- obtains pointer to next available job entry
submit_job()   \- submits job for processing
get_completed_job() \- returns already completed jobs
flush_job()    \- flushes multi-buffer manager and completes any outstanding operations.
.fi

The basic usage of the API is presented by this pseudo code:
.br
.nf

        init_mb_mgr(&mb_mgr);
        ...
        while (work_to_be_done) {
                job = get_next_job(&mb_mgr);
                /* TODO: Fill in job fields */
                job = submit_job(&mb_mgr);
                while (job != NULL) {
                        /* TODO: Complete processing on job */
    	                job = get_completed_job(&mb_mgr);
                }
        }

        job = flush_job(&mb_mgr);
        while (job != NULL) {
                /* TODO: Complete processing on job */
    	        job = flush_job(&mb_mgr);
        }

.fi
The library provides more interface functions i.e. single block hash functions for HMAC OPAD and IPAD calculations.
