GENERATING NEW TEST
	To add new test, run "add_new_test_file.py" with two parameters:
		- tested file path (path must be relative to your current working dir)
		- tested function name
	Generated file name may be changed without any consequences.

	Good practise is to use "add_new_test_file.py" script from test directory (not framework),
	because it prepend appropriate license header.

RUNNING SINGLE TEST
	Executable tests files are stored by default in 'UT_dir/build/sources_to_test_repository/'

REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILD:
- cmocka
- cmake
- ctags (Exuberant version)
- nm, gcc, make
