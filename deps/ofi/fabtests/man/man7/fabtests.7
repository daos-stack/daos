Fabtests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
Fabtests is a set of examples for fabric providers that demonstrates
various features of libfabric- high-performance fabric software library.
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
Libfabric defines sets of interface that fabric providers can support.
The purpose of Fabtests examples is to demonstrate some of the major
features.
The goal is to familiarize users with different functionalities
libfabric offers and how to use them.
Although most tests report performance numbers, they are designed to
test functionality and not performance.
The exception are the benchmarks and ubertest.
.PP
The tests are divided into the following categories.
Except the unit tests all of them are client-server tests.
Not all providers will support each test.
.PP
The test names try to indicate the type of functionality each test is
verifying.
Although some tests work with any endpoint type, many are restricted to
verifying a single endpoint type.
These tests typically include the endpoint type as part of the test
name, such as dgram, msg, or rdm.
.SS Functional
.PP
These tests are a mix of very basic functionality tests that show major
features of libfabric.

between each transfer, but the virtual address of the transmit buffer
tries to remain the same.
This test is used to validate the correct behavior of memory
registration caches.
.TP
\f[I]fi_bw\f[R]
Performs a one-sided bandwidth test with an option for data
verification.
A sleep time on the receiving side can be enabled in order to allow the
sender to get ahead of the receiver.
.TP
\f[I]fi_rdm_multi_client\f[R]
Tests a persistent server communicating with multiple clients, one at a
time, in sequence.
.SS Benchmarks
.PP
The client and the server exchange messages in either a ping-pong
manner, for pingpong named tests, or transfer messages one-way, for bw
named tests.
These tests can transfer various messages sizes, with controls over
which features are used by the test, and report performance numbers.
The tests are structured based on the benchmarks provided by OSU MPI.
They are not guaranteed to provide the best latency or bandwidth
performance numbers a given provider or system may achieve.
.TP
\f[I]fi_dgram_pingpong\f[R]
Latency test for datagram endpoints
.TP
\f[I]fi_msg_bw\f[R]

endpoints.
.TP
\f[I]fi_rma_pingpong\f[R]
An RMA write and writedata latency test for reliable-datagram (RDM)
endpoints.
.SS Unit
.PP
These are simple one-sided unit tests that validate basic behavior of
the API.
Because these are single system tests that do not perform data transfers
their testing scope is limited.
.TP
\f[I]fi_av_test\f[R]
Verify address vector interfaces.
.TP
\f[I]fi_cntr_test\f[R]
Tests counter creation and destruction.
.TP
\f[I]fi_cq_test\f[R]
Tests completion queue creation and destruction.
.TP
\f[I]fi_dom_test\f[R]

Tests memory registration.
.TP
\f[I]fi_mr_cache_evict\f[R]
Tests provider MR cache eviction capabilities.
.SS Multinode
.PP
This test runs a series of tests over multiple formats and patterns to
help validate at scale.
The patterns are an all to all, one to all, all to one and a ring.
The tests also run across multiple capabilities, such as messages, rma,
atomics, and tagged messages.
Currently, there is no option to run these capabilities and patterns
independently, however the test is short enough to be all run at once.
.SS Ubertest
.PP
This is a comprehensive latency, bandwidth, and functionality test that
can handle a variety of test configurations.
The test is able to run a large number of tests by iterating over a
large number of test variables.
As a result, a full ubertest run can take a significant amount of time.
Because ubertest iterates over input variables, it relies on a test
configuration file for control, rather than extensive command line
options that are used by other fabtests.
A configuration file must be constructed for each provider.
Example test configurations are at test_configs.
.TP
\f[I]fi_ubertest\f[R]
This test takes a configure file as input.
The file contains a list of variables and their values to iterate over.
The test will run a set of latency, bandwidth, and functionality tests
over a given provider.
It will perform one execution for every possible combination of all
variables.
For example, if there are 8 test variables, with 6 having 2 possible
values and 2 having 3 possible values, ubertest will execute 576 total
iterations of each test.
.SH EFA provider specific tests
.PP
Beyond libfabric defined functionalities, EFA provider defines its
specific features/functionalities.
These EFA provider specific fabtests show users how to correctly use
them.
.TP
\f[I]fi_efa_rnr_read_cq_error\f[R]
This test modifies the RNR retry count (rnr_retry) to 0 via fi_setopt,
and then runs a simple program to test if the error cq entry (with error
FI_ENORX) can be read by the application, if RNR happens.
.TP
\f[I]fi_efa_rnr_queue_resend\f[R]
This test modifies the RNR retry count (rnr_retry) to 0 via fi_setopt,
and then tests RNR queue/re-send logic for different packet types.
To run the test, one needs to use \f[C]-c\f[R] option to specify the
category of packet types.
.SS Component tests
.PP
These stand-alone tests don\[cq]t test libfabric functionalities.
Instead, they test some components that libfabric depend on.
They are not called by runfabtests.sh, either, and don\[cq]t follow the
fabtests coventions for naming, config file, and command line options.
.SS Dmabuf RDMA tests
.PP
These tests check the functionality or performance of dmabuf based GPU
RDMA mechanism.
They use oneAPI level-zero API to allocate buffer from device memory,
get dmabuf handle, and perform some device memory related operations.
Run with the \f[I]-h\f[R] option to see all available options for each
of the tests.
.TP
\f[I]xe_rdmabwe\f[R]
This Verbs test measures the bandwidth of RDMA operations.
It runs in client-server mode.
It has options to choose buffer location, test type (write, read,
send/recv), device unit(s), NIC unit(s), message size, and the number of
iterations per message size.
.TP
\f[I]fi_xe_rdmabw\f[R]
This test is similar to \f[I]xe_rdmabw\f[R], but uses libfabric instead
of Verbs.
.TP
\f[I]xe_mr_reg\f[R]
This Verbs test tries to register a buffer with the RDMA NIC.
.TP
\f[I]fi_xe_mr_reg\f[R]
This test is similar to \f[I]xe_mr_reg\f[R], but uses libfabric instead
of Verbs.
.TP
\f[I]xe_memcopy\f[R]
This test measures the performance of memory copy operations between
buffers.
It has options for buffer locations, as well as memory copying methods
to use (memcpy, mmap + memcpy, copy with device command queue, etc).

completed.
The sread option indicates that the application will invoke a blocking
read call in libfabric, such as fi_cq_sread.

system wait object (file descriptor) and use either poll() or select()
to block until the fd has been signaled, prior to checking for
completions.
