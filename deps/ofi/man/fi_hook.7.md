# NAME

fi_hook \- The Hook Fabric Provider Utility

# OVERVIEW

The hooking provider is a utility function that can intercept calls to any
provider.  The hook provider is always available, but has zero impact on
calls unless enabled.  It is useful for providing performance data on
selected calls or debugging information.

# SUPPORTED FEATURES

Hooking support is enabled through the FI_HOOK environment variable.  To
enable hooking, FI_HOOK must be set to the name of one or more of the
available hooking providers.  When multiple hooks are specified, the
names must be separated by a semi-colon.  To obtain a list of hooking
providers available on the current system, one can use the fi_info
utility with the '--env' command line option.  Hooking providers are
usually identified by 'hook' appearing in the provider name.

Known hooking providers include the following:

*ofi_hook_perf*
: This hooks 'fast path' data operation calls.  Performance data is
  captured on call entrance and exit, in order to provide an average of
  how long each call takes to complete.  See the PERFORMANCE HOOKS section
  for available performance data.

*ofi_hook_trace*
: This hooks most of API calls for fabric communications. The APIs and their
  runtime parameters are logged to provide detail trace information for
  debugging. See the TRACE HOOKS section for the APIs enabled for trace.

*ofi_hook_profile*
: This hooks data operation calls, cq operation calls and mr registration
  calls. The API calls and the amount of data being operated are accumulated,
  to provide a view of APIs' usages and a histogram of data size operated
  in a workload execution. See the PROFILE HOOKS section for the report in
  the detail.

# PERFORMANCE HOOKS

The hook provider allows capturing inline performance data by accessing the
CPU Performance Management Unit (PMU).  PMU data is only available on Linux
systems.  Additionally, access to PMU data may be restricted to privileged
(super-user) applications.

Performance data is captured for critical data transfer calls:
fi_msg, fi_rma, fi_tagged, fi_cq, and fi_cntr.  Captured data is displayed
as logged data using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace level.  Performance data is
logged when the associated fabric is destroyed.

The environment variable FI_PERF_CNTR is used to identify which performance
counter is tracked.  The following counters are available:

*cpu_cycles*
: Counts the number of CPU cycles each function takes to complete.

*cpu_instr*
: Counts the number of CPU instructions each function takes to complete.
  This is the default performance counter if none is specified.

# TRACE HOOKS

This hook provider allows tracing each API call and its runtime parameters.
It is enabled by setting FI_HOOK to "trace".

The trace data include the provider's name, API function, and input/output
parameter values.Â The APIs enabled for tracing include the following:

*data operation calls*
: This include fi_msg, fi_rma, fi_tagged all data operations. The trace data
  contains the data buffer, data size being operated, data, tags, and flags
  when applicable.

*cq operation calls*
: This includes fi_cq_read, fi_cq_sread, fi_cq_strerror and all cq operations.
  The trace data contains the cq entries based on cq format.

*cm operation calls*
: This includes fi_getname, fi_setname, fi_getpeer, fi_connect and all cm
  operations. The trace data contains the target address.

*resource creation calls*
: This includes fi_av_open, fi_cq_open, fi_endpoing, fi_cntr_open and fi_mr
  operations. The trace data contains the corresponding attributes used for
  resource creation.

The trace data is logged after API is invoked using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace
level

# PROFILE HOOKS

This hook provider allows capturing data operation calls and the amount of
data being operated. It is enabled by setting FI_HOOK to "profile".

The provider counts the API invoked and accumulates the data size each API
call operates. For data and cq operations, instead of accumulating all data
together, it breaks down the data size into size buckets and accumulates
the amount of data in the corresponding bucket based on the size of the data
operated. For mr registration operations, it breaks down memory registered
per HMEM iface. At the end when the associated fabric is destroyed, the
provider generates a profile report.

The report contains the usage of data operation APIs, the amount of data
received in each CQ format and the amount of memory registered for rma
operations if any exist. In addition, the data operation APIs are grouped
into 4 groups based on the nature of the operations, message send (fi_sendXXX,
fi_tsendXXX), message receive (fi_recvXXX, fi_trecvXXX), rma read (fi_readXXX)
and rma write (fi_writeXXX) to present the percentage usage of each API.

The report is in a table format which has APIs invoked in rows, and the columns
contain the following fields:

*API*
: The API calls are invoked.

*Size*
: Data size bucket that at least one API call operates data in that size bucket.
  The pre-defined size buckets (in Byte) are [0-64] [64-512] [512-1K] [1K-4K]
  [4K-64K] [64K-256K] [256K-1M] [1M-4M] [4M-UP].

*Count*
: Count of the API calls.

*Amount*
: Amount of data the API operated.

*% Count*
: Percentage of the API calls over the total API calls in the same data operation
  group.

*% Amount*
: Percentage of the amount of data from the API over the total amount
  of data operated in the same data operation group.

The report is logged using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace level.

# LIMITATIONS

Hooking functionality is not available for providers built using the
FI_FABRIC_DIRECT feature.  That is, directly linking to a provider prevents
hooking.

The hooking provider does not work with triggered operations.  Application
that use FI_TRIGGER operations that attempt to hook calls will likely crash.
