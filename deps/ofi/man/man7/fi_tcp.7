.SH NAME
.PP
fi_tcp - Provider that runs over TCP/IP
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The tcp provider is usable on all operation systems supported by
libfabric.
It runs over TCP (SOCK_STREAM) sockets, and includes the ability to
leverage operation specific features, such as support for zero-copy and
io_uring.
The provider implements a custom protocol over TCP/IP needed to support
the libfabric communication APIs.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
The following features are supported
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint types\f[R]
\f[I]FI_EP_MSG\f[R]
\f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint capabilities\f[R]
\f[I]FI_MSG\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[R], \f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[R],
\f[I]FI_RMA_PMEM\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA_EVENT\f[R], \f[I]FI_MULTI_RECV\f[R],
\f[I]FI_DIRECTED_RECV\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]Shared Rx Context\f[R]
The tcp provider supports shared receive context
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
The tcp provider may be configured using several environment variables.
A subset of supported variables is defined below.
For a full list, use the fi_info utility application.
For example, `fi_info -g tcp' will show all environment variables
defined for the tcp provider.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_IFACE\f[R]
A specific network interface can be requested with this variable
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_PORT_LOW_RANGE/FI_TCP_PORT_HIGH_RANGE\f[R]
These variables are used to set the range of ports to be used by the tcp
provider for its passive endpoint creation.
This is useful where only a range of ports are allowed by firewall for
tcp connections.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_TX_SIZE\f[R]
Transmit context size.
This is the number of transmit requests that an application may post to
the provider before receiving -FI_EAGAIN.
Default: 256 for msg endpoints, 64k for rdm.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_RX_SIZE\f[R]
Receive context size.
This is the number of receive buffers that the application may post to
the provider.
Default: 256 for msg endpoints, 64k for rdm.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_MAX_INJECT\f[R]
Maximum size of inject messages and the maximum size of an unexpected
message that may be buffered at the receiver.
Default 128 bytes.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_STAGING_SBUF_SIZE\f[R]
Size of buffer used to coalesce iovec\[cq]s or send requests before
posting to the kernel.
The staging buffer is used when the socket is busy and cannot accept new
data.
In that case, the data can be queued in the staging buffer until the
socket resumes sending.
This optimizes transfering a series of back-to-back small messages to
the same target.
Default: 9000 bytes.
Set to 0 to disable.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_PREFETCH_RBUF_SIZE\f[R]
Size of the buffer used to prefetch received data from the kernel.
When starting to receive a new message, the provider will request that
the kernel fill the prefetch buffer and process received data from
there.
This reduces the number of kernel calls needed to receive a series of
small messages.
Default: 9000 bytes.
Set to 0 to disable.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_ZEROCOPY_SIZE\f[R]
Lower threshold where zero copy transfers will be used, if supported by
the platform, set to -1 to disable.
Default: disabled.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_TRACE_MSG\f[R]
If enabled, will log transport message information on all sent and
received messages.
Must be paired with FI_LOG_LEVEL=trace to print the message details.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_IO_URING\f[R]
Uses io_uring for socket operations if available, rather than going
through the standard socket APIs (i.e.\ connect, accept, send, recv).
Default: disabled.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The tcp provider supports both msg and rdm endpoints directly.
Support for rdm endpoints is available starting at libfabric version
v1.18.0, and comes from the merge back of the net provider found in
libfabric versions v1.16 and v1.17.
For compatibility with older libfabric versions, the tcp provider may be
paired with the ofi_rxm provider as an alternative solution for rdm
endpoint support.
It is recommended that applications that do not need wire compatibility
with older versions of libfabric use the rdm endpoint support directly
from the tcp provider.
This will provide the best performance.
