fabric - Fabric Interface Library
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
#include <rdma/fabric.h>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Libfabric is a high-performance fabric software library designed to
provide low-latency interfaces to fabric hardware.
For an in-depth discussion of the motivation and design see
\f[C]fi_guide\f[R](7).
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
Libfabric provides `process direct I/O' to application software
communicating across fabric software and hardware.
Process direct I/O, historically referred to as RDMA, allows an
application to directly access network resources without operating
system interventions.
Data transfers can occur directly to and from application memory.
.PP
There are two components to the libfabric software:
.TP
\f[I]Fabric Providers\f[R]
Conceptually, a fabric provider may be viewed as a local hardware NIC
driver, though a provider is not limited by this definition.
The first component of libfabric is a general purpose framework that is
capable of handling different types of fabric hardware.
All fabric hardware devices and their software drivers are required to
support this framework.
Devices and the drivers that plug into the libfabric framework are
referred to as fabric providers, or simply providers.
Provider details may be found in \f[C]fi_provider\f[R](7).
.TP
\f[I]Fabric Interfaces\f[R]
The second component is a set of communication operations.
Libfabric defines several sets of communication functions that providers
can support.
It is not required that providers implement all the interfaces that are
defined; however, providers clearly indicate which interfaces they do
support.
.SH FABRIC INTERFACES
.PP
The fabric interfaces are designed such that they are cohesive and not
simply a union of disjoint interfaces.
The interfaces are logically divided into two groups: control interfaces
and communication operations.
The control interfaces are a common set of operations that provide
access to local communication resources, such as address vectors and
event queues.
The communication operations expose particular models of communication
and fabric functionality, such as message queues, remote memory access,
and atomic operations.
Communication operations are associated with fabric endpoints.
.PP
Applications will typically use the control interfaces to discover local
capabilities and allocate necessary resources.
They will then allocate and configure a communication endpoint to send
and receive data, or perform other types of data transfers, with remote
endpoints.
.SH CONTROL INTERFACES
.PP
The control interfaces APIs provide applications access to network
resources.
This involves listing all the interfaces available, obtaining the
capabilities of the interfaces and opening a provider.
.TP
\f[I]fi_getinfo - Fabric Information\f[R]
The fi_getinfo call is the base call used to discover and request fabric
services offered by the system.
Applications can use this call to indicate the type of communication
that they desire.
The results from fi_getinfo, fi_info, are used to reserve and configure
fabric resources.
.PP
fi_getinfo returns a list of fi_info structures.
Each structure references a single fabric provider, indicating the
interfaces that the provider supports, along with a named set of
resources.
A fabric provider may include multiple fi_info structures in the
returned list.
.TP
\f[I]fi_fabric - Fabric Domain\f[R]
A fabric domain represents a collection of hardware and software
resources that access a single physical or virtual network.
All network ports on a system that can communicate with each other
through the fabric belong to the same fabric domain.
A fabric domain shares network addresses and can span multiple
providers.
libfabric supports systems connected to multiple fabrics.
.TP
\f[I]fi_domain - Access Domains\f[R]
An access domain represents a single logical connection into a fabric.
It may map to a single physical or virtual NIC or a port.
An access domain defines the boundary across which fabric resources may
be associated.
Each access domain belongs to a single fabric domain.
.TP
\f[I]fi_endpoint - Fabric Endpoint\f[R]
A fabric endpoint is a communication portal.
An endpoint may be either active or passive.
Passive endpoints are used to listen for connection requests.
Active endpoints can perform data transfers.
Endpoints are configured with specific communication capabilities and
data transfer interfaces.
.TP
\f[I]fi_eq - Event Queue\f[R]
Event queues, are used to collect and report the completion of
asynchronous operations and events.
Event queues report events that are not directly associated with data
transfer operations.
.TP
\f[I]fi_cq - Completion Queue\f[R]
Completion queues are high-performance event queues used to report the
completion of data transfer operations.
.TP
\f[I]fi_cntr - Event Counters\f[R]
Event counters are used to report the number of completed asynchronous
operations.
Event counters are considered light-weight, in that a completion simply
increments a counter, rather than placing an entry into an event queue.
.TP
\f[I]fi_mr - Memory Region\f[R]
Memory regions describe application local memory buffers.
In order for fabric resources to access application memory, the
application must first grant permission to the fabric provider by
constructing a memory region.
Memory regions are required for specific types of data transfer
operations, such as RMA transfers (see below).
.TP
\f[I]fi_av - Address Vector\f[R]
Address vectors are used to map higher level addresses, such as IP
addresses, which may be more natural for an application to use, into
fabric specific addresses.
The use of address vectors allows providers to reduce the amount of
memory required to maintain large address look-up tables, and eliminate
expensive address resolution and look-up methods during data transfer
operations.
.SH DATA TRANSFER INTERFACES
.PP
Fabric endpoints are associated with multiple data transfer interfaces.
Each interface set is designed to support a specific style of
communication, with an endpoint allowing the different interfaces to be
used in conjunction.
The following data transfer interfaces are defined by libfabric.
.TP
\f[I]fi_msg - Message Queue\f[R]
Message queues expose a simple, message-based FIFO queue interface to
the application.
Message data transfers allow applications to send and receive data with
message boundaries being maintained.
.TP
\f[I]fi_tagged - Tagged Message Queues\f[R]
Tagged message lists expose send/receive data transfer operations built
on the concept of tagged messaging.
The tagged message queue is conceptually similar to standard message
queues, but with the addition of 64-bit tags for each message.
Sent messages are matched with receive buffers that are tagged with a
similar value.
.TP
\f[I]fi_rma - Remote Memory Access\f[R]
RMA transfers are one-sided operations that read or write data directly
to a remote memory region.
Other than defining the appropriate memory region, RMA operations do not
require interaction at the target side for the data transfer to
complete.
.TP
\f[I]fi_atomic - Atomic\f[R]
Atomic operations can perform one of several operations on a remote
memory region.
Atomic operations include well-known functionality, such as atomic-add
and compare-and-swap, plus several other pre-defined calls.
Unlike other data transfer interfaces, atomic operations are aware of
the data formatting at the target memory region.
.SH LOGGING INTERFACE
.PP
Logging can be controlled using the FI_LOG_LEVEL, FI_LOG_PROV, and
FI_LOG_SUBSYS environment variables.
.TP
\f[I]FI_LOG_LEVEL\f[R]
FI_LOG_LEVEL controls the amount of logging data that is output.
The following log levels are defined.
.TP
- \f[I]Warn\f[R]
Warn is the least verbose setting and is intended for reporting errors
or warnings.
.TP
- \f[I]Trace\f[R]
Trace is more verbose and is meant to include non-detailed output
helpful to tracing program execution.
.TP
- \f[I]Info\f[R]
Info is high traffic and meant for detailed output.
.TP
- \f[I]Debug\f[R]
Debug is high traffic and is likely to impact application performance.
Debug output is only available if the library has been compiled with
debugging enabled.
.TP
\f[I]FI_LOG_PROV\f[R]
The FI_LOG_PROV environment variable enables or disables logging from
specific providers.
Providers can be enabled by listing them in a comma separated fashion.
If the list begins with the `\[ha]' symbol, then the list will be
negated.
By default all providers are enabled.
.PP
Example: To enable logging from the psm3 and sockets provider:
FI_LOG_PROV=\[lq]psm3,sockets\[rq]
.PP
Example: To enable logging from providers other than psm3:
FI_LOG_PROV=\[lq]\[ha]psm3\[rq]
.TP
\f[I]FI_LOG_SUBSYS\f[R]
The FI_LOG_SUBSYS environment variable enables or disables logging at
the subsystem level.
The syntax for enabling or disabling subsystems is similar to that used
for FI_LOG_PROV.
The following subsystems are defined.
.TP
- \f[I]core\f[R]
Provides output related to the core framework and its management of
providers.
.TP
- \f[I]fabric\f[R]
Provides output specific to interactions associated with the fabric
object.
.TP
- \f[I]domain\f[R]
Provides output specific to interactions associated with the domain
object.
.TP
- \f[I]ep_ctrl\f[R]
Provides output specific to endpoint non-data transfer operations, such
as CM operations.
.TP
- \f[I]ep_data\f[R]
Provides output specific to endpoint data transfer operations.
.TP
- \f[I]av\f[R]
Provides output specific to address vector operations.
.TP
- \f[I]cq\f[R]
Provides output specific to completion queue operations.
.TP
- \f[I]eq\f[R]
Provides output specific to event queue operations.
.TP
- \f[I]mr\f[R]
Provides output specific to memory registration.
.SH PROVIDER INSTALLATION AND SELECTION
.PP
The libfabric build scripts will install all providers that are
supported by the installation system.
Providers that are missing build prerequisites will be disabled.
Installed providers will dynamically check for necessary hardware on
library initialization and respond appropriately to application queries.
.PP
Users can enable or disable available providers through build
configuration options.
See `configure \[en]help' for details.
In general, a specific provider can be controlled using the configure
option `\[en]enable-'.
For example, `\[en]enable-udp' (or `\[en]enable-udp=yes') will add the
udp provider to the build.
To disable the provider, `\[en]enable-udp=no' can be used.
To build the provider as a stand-alone dynamically loadable library
(i.e.\ DL provider), `\[en]enable-udp=dl' can be used.
.PP
Providers can also be enable or disabled at run time using the
FI_PROVIDER environment variable.
The FI_PROVIDER variable is set to a comma separated list of providers
to include.
If the list begins with the `\[ha]' symbol, then the list will be
negated.
.PP
Example: To enable the udp and tcp providers only, set:
\f[C]FI_PROVIDER=\[dq]udp,tcp\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
When libfabric is installed, DL providers are put under the \f[I]default
provider path\f[R], which is determined by how libfabric is built and
installed.
Usually the default provider path is
\f[C]<libfabric-install-dir>/lib/libfabric\f[R] or
\f[C]<libfabric-install-dir>/lib64/libfabric\f[R].
By default, libfabric tries to find DL providers in the following order:
.IP "1." 3
Use `dlopen' to load provider libraries named
\f[C]lib<prov_name>-fi.so\f[R] for all providers enabled at build time.
The search path of `ld.so' is used to locate the files.
This step is skipped if libfabric is configured with the option
`\[en]enable-restricted-dl'.
.IP "2." 3
Try to load every file under the default provider path as a DL provider.
.PP
The FI_PROVIDER_PATH variable can be used to change the location to
search for DL providers and how to resolve conflicts if multiple
providers with the same name are found.
Setting FI_PROVIDER_PATH to any value, even if empty, would cause step 1
be skipped, and may change the search directory used in step 2.
.PP
In the simplest form, the FI_PROVIDER_PATH variable is set to a colon
separated list of directories.
These directories replace the default provider path used in step 2.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=/opt/libfabric:/opt/libfabric2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
By default, if multiple providers (including the built-in providers)
with the same name are found, the first one with the highest version is
active and all the others are hidden.
This can be changed by setting the FI_PROVIDER_PATH variable to start
with `\[at]', which force the first one to be active regardless of the
version.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=\[at]/opt/libfabric:/opt/libfabric2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The FI_PROVIDER_PATH variable can also specify preferred providers by
supplying full paths to libraries instead of directories to search
under.
A preferred provider takes precedence over other providers with the same
name.
The specification of a preferred provider must be prefixed with `+'.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=+/opt/libfabric2/libtcp-fi.so:/opt/libfabric:+/opt/libfabric2/libudp-fi.so
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If FI_PROVIDER_PATH is set, but no directory is supplied, the default
provider path is used.
Some examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=\[at]
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=+/opt/libfabric/libtcp-fi.so
FI_PROVIDER_PATH=\[at]+/opt/libfabric/libtcp-fi.so
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The fi_info utility, which is included as part of the libfabric package,
can be used to retrieve information about which providers are available
in the system.
Additionally, it can retrieve a list of all environment variables that
may be used to configure libfabric and each provider.
See \f[C]fi_info\f[R](1) for more details.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE CONTROLS
.PP
Core features of libfabric and its providers may be configured by an
administrator through the use of environment variables.
Man pages will usually describe the most commonly accessed variables,
such as those mentioned above.
However, libfabric defines interfaces for publishing and obtaining
environment variables.
These are targeted for providers, but allow applications and users to
obtain the full list of variables that may be set, along with a brief
description of their use.
.PP
A full list of variables available may be obtained by running the
fi_info application, with the -e or \[en]env command line option.
.SH NOTES
.SS System Calls
.PP
Because libfabric is designed to provide applications direct access to
fabric hardware, there are limits on how libfabric resources may be used
in conjunction with system calls.
These limitations are notable for developers who may be familiar
programming to the sockets interface.
Although limits are provider specific, the following restrictions apply
to many providers and should be adhered to by applications desiring
portability across providers.
.TP
\f[I]fork\f[R]
Fabric resources are not guaranteed to be available by child processes.
This includes objects, such as endpoints and completion queues, as well
as application controlled data buffers which have been assigned to the
network.
For example, data buffers that have been registered with a fabric domain
may not be available in a child process because of copy on write
restrictions.
.SS CUDA deadlock
.PP
In some cases, calls to \f[C]cudaMemcpy()\f[R] within libfabric may
result in a deadlock.
This typically occurs when a CUDA kernel blocks until a
\f[C]cudaMemcpy\f[R] on the host completes.
Applications which can cause such behavior can restrict Libfabric\[cq]s
ability to invoke CUDA API operations with the endpoint option
\f[C]FI_OPT_CUDA_API_PERMITTED\f[R].
See \f[C]fi_endpoint\f[R](3) for more details.
.PP
Another mechanism which can be used to avoid deadlock is Nvidia\[cq]s
GDRCopy.
Using GDRCopy requires an external library and kernel module available
at https://github.com/NVIDIA/gdrcopy.
Libfabric must be configured with GDRCopy support using the
\f[C]--with-gdrcopy\f[R] option, and be run with
\f[C]FI_HMEM_CUDA_USE_GDRCOPY=1\f[R].
This may not be supported by all providers.
.SH ABI CHANGES
.PP
libfabric releases maintain compatibility with older releases, so that
compiled applications can continue to work as-is, and previously written
applications will compile against newer versions of the library without
needing source code changes.
The changes below describe ABI updates that have occurred and which
libfabric release corresponds to the changes.
.PP
Note that because most functions called by applications actually call
static inline functions, which in turn reference function pointers in
order to call directly into providers, libfabric only exports a handful
of functions directly.
ABI changes are limited to those functions, most notably the fi_getinfo
call and its returned attribute structures.
.PP
The ABI version is independent from the libfabric release version.
.SS ABI 1.0
.PP
The initial libfabric release (1.0.0) also corresponds to ABI version
1.0.
The 1.0 ABI was unchanged for libfabric major.minor versions 1.0, 1.1,
1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.
.SS ABI 1.1
.PP
A number of external data structures were appended starting with
libfabric version 1.5.
These changes included adding the fields to the following data
structures.
The 1.1 ABI was exported by libfabric versions 1.5 and 1.6.
.TP
\f[I]fi_fabric_attr\f[R]
Added api_version
.TP
\f[I]fi_domain_attr\f[R]
Added cntr_cnt, mr_iov_limit, caps, mode, auth_key, auth_key_size,
max_err_data, and mr_cnt fields.
The mr_mode field was also changed from an enum to an integer flag
field.
.TP
\f[I]fi_ep_attr\f[R]
Added auth_key_size and auth_key fields.
.SS ABI 1.2
.PP
The 1.2 ABI version was exported by libfabric versions 1.7 and 1.8, and
expanded the following structure.
.TP
\f[I]fi_info\f[R]
The fi_info structure was expanded to reference a new fabric object,
fid_nic.
When available, the fid_nic references a new set of attributes related
to network hardware details.
.SS ABI 1.3
.PP
The 1.3 ABI version was exported by libfabric versions 1.9, 1.10, and
1.11.
