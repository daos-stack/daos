/**
 * @brief Packet entry
 * 
 * efa_rdm_pke (pke stands for packet entry) is used the following occassions:
 * 
 * First, it is used as the work request ID for the request EFA provider posted to EFA
 * device via rdma-core:
 * 
 * For each request EFA provider submits to EFA device, it will allocate a packet entry.
 * 
 * When the request was submitted to rdma-core, the pointer of the packet entry will be used as work
 * request ID (`wr_id`).
 * 
 * When the request was completed, rdma-core return a completion, with the "wr_id"
 * in it, so EFA provder knows which request has completed.
 * 
 * Sometimes, the completion can be a Receiver Not Ready (RNR) error completion.
 * In that case the packet entry will be queued and resubmitted. For the resubmission,
 * the packet entry must contain all the information of the request.
 * 
 * EFA device (rdma-core) supported request types are:
 *  send and receive (by all EFA device)
 *  read and write (by certain EFA device)
 * 
 * a send/read/write request uses a packet entry allocated from endpoint's efa_tx_pkt_pool.
 * a read request uses a packet entry allocated from efa_rx_pkt_pool. Both pool's memories
 * are registeredd with efa device, the registration is stored in
 * the "mr" field of the packet entry.
 * 
 * Second, packet entries can be used to store received packet entries that is
 * unexpected or out-of-order. This is because the efa_rx_pkt_pool's size is fixed,
 * therefore it cannot be used to hold unexpected/out-of-order packets. When an unexpected/out-of-order
 * packet is received, a new packet entry will be cloned from unexpected/ooo_pkt_pool.
 * The old packet will be released then reposted to EFA device or SHM. The new packet
 * (allocated from unexpected/ooo_pkt_pool)'s memory is not registered
 * 
 * Finally, packet entries can be used to support local read copy. Local read copy means
 * to copy data from a packet entry to HMEM receive buffer through EFA device's read capability.
 * Local require a packet entry's memory to be registered with device. If the packet entry's memory
 * is not registered (when it is unexpected or out-of-order). A new packet entry will be cloned
 * using endpoint's read_copy_pkt_pool, whose memory was registered.
