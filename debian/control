Package: daos

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, openmpi-bin
Description: The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open-source
 software-defined object store designed from the ground up for
 massively distributed Non Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage
 of next generation NVM technology like Storage Class Memory (SCM) and
 NVM express (NVMe) while presenting a key-value storage interface and
 providing features such as transactional non-blocking I/O, advanced
 data protection with self healing on top of commodity hardware, end-
 to-end data integrity, fine grained data control and elastic storage
 to optimize performance and cost.
 .
 This package contains the common components.
