# MPI-IO Support

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) Standard, 
maintained by the [MPI Forum](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/),
includes a chapter on MPI-IO. 

[ROMIO](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/projects/romio/) is a well-known
implementation of MPI-IO and is included in many MPI implementations.
DAOS provides its own MPI-IO ROMIO ADIO driver.
This driver has been merged in the upstream MPICH repository, see
https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/tree/main/src/mpi/romio/adio/ad_daos
for details.


## MPI Implementations that support DAOS

### MPICH

The DAOS ROMIO ADIO driver has been accepted into [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/).
It is included in [mpich-3.4b1 (alpha release)](https://www.mpich.org/downloads/),
but not in mpich-3.3.2 (stable release).

### Building MPICH with DAOS Support

To build MPICH, including ROMIO with the DAOS ADIO driver:

```bash
export MPI_LIB=""

git clone https://github.com/daos-stack/mpich

cd mpich

./autogen.sh

mkdir build; cd build

../configure --prefix=dir --enable-fortran=all --enable-romio \
  --enable-cxx --enable-g=all --enable-debuginfo --with-device=ch3:sock \
  --with-file-system=ufs+daos --with-daos=/usr --with-cart=/usr

make -j8; make install
```

This assumes that DAOS is installed into the `/usr` tree, 
which is the case for the DAOS RPM installation.

!!! note
    In DAOS 1.0, CART was packaged separately from DAOS, and the
    `--with-cart` option was needed to allow separate installation locations. 
    With DAOS 1.1 or higher, CART is included in the main DAOS packages 
    and the `--with-cart` option is no longer needed. 
    An MPICH pull request is in process to remove the option from the MPICH
    `configure` step, but currently it is still required to build MPICH.

Set the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to where you want to build your client
apps or libs that use MPI to the path of the installed MPICH.


### Intel MPI

The [Intel MPI Library](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/mpi-library.html) 
includes DAOS support since the 
[2019.8 release](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mpi-library-release-notes-linux.html).

Note that Intel MPI uses `libfabric` (both 2019.8 and 2019.9 use 
`libfabric-1.10.1-impi`).  
Care must be taken to ensure that the version of libfabric that is used 
is at a level that includes the patches that are critical for DAOS.
DAOS 1.0.1 includes `libfabric-1.9.0`, and the DAOS 1.1.2 pre-release 
includes `libfabric-1.11.1`. 

To use DAOS 1.1 with Intel MPI 2019.8 or 2019.9, the `libfabric` that 
is supplied by DAOS (and that is installed into `/usr/lib64` by default) 
needs to be used by listing it first in the library search path:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

The next Intel MPI release is expected to contain a version of `libfabric`
that includes all patches to work with DAOS. 
It will then no longer be necessary to override the `libfabric` version that is 
shipped with Intel MPI by the version provided by DAOS.


### Open MPI

[Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) 4.0.5 does not yet provide DAOS support.
Since one of its MPI-IO implementations is based on ROMIO, 
it will likely pick up DAOS support in an upcoming release.

### MVAPICH2

[MVAPICH2](https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/) 2.3.4 does not yet provide DAOS support.
Since its MPI-IO implementation is based on ROMIO, 
it will likely pick up DAOS support in an upcoming release.


## Testing MPI-IO with DAOS Support

Build any client (HDF5, ior, mpi test suites) normally with the mpicc command
and mpich library installed above (see child pages).

To run an example with MPI-IO:

1. Create a DAOS pool on the DAOS server(s).
   This will return a pool uuid "puuid" and service rank list "svcl".
2. Create a POSIX type container:
   `daos cont create --pool=puuid --type=POSIX`
   This will return a container uuid "cuuid".
3. At the client side, the following environment variables need to be set:
   `export DAOS_POOL=puuid; export DAOS_SVCL=svcl; export DAOS_CONT=cuuid`.
   Alternatively, the unified namespace mode can be used instead.
3. Run the client application or test. 
   MPI-IO applications should work seamlessly by just prepending `daos:` 
   to the filename/path to use the DAOS ADIO driver.


## Known limitations

Limitations of the current implementation include:

-   Reading Holes does not return 0, but leaves the buffer untouched.

-   No support for MPI file atomicity, preallocate, or shared file pointers.
