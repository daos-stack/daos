# DAOS System Deployment

## Preflight Checklist

This section covers the preliminary setup required on the compute and
storage nodes before deploying DAOS.

For the impatient, skip to [Basic Workflows](#-basic-workflow) for
commands to get you started quickly.

### Time Synchronization

The DAOS transaction model relies on timestamps and requires time to be
synchronized across all the storage and client nodes. This can be done
via NTP or any other equivalent protocol.

### User & Group

DAOS requires users and groups to be synchronized on both storage and
client nodes.

### Runtime Directory Setup

DAOS uses a series of Unix Domain Sockets to communicate between its
various components. On modern Linux systems Unix Domain Sockets are
typically stored under /run or /var/run (usually a symlink to /run) and
are a mounted tmpfs file system. There are several methods for ensuring
the necessary directories are setup.

A sign that this step may have been missed is when starting daos\_server
or daos\_agent you may see the message:

mkdir /var/run/daos\_server: permission denied

Unable to create socket directory: /var/run/daos\_server

#### Non-default Directory

By default daos\_server and daos\_agent will use the directories
/var/run/daos\_server and /var/run/daos\_agent respectively. To change
the default location that daos\_server uses for its runtime directory
either uncomment and set the socket\_dir configuration value in
install/etc/daos\_server.yaml or pass the location to daos\_server on
the command line using the -d flag. For the daos\_agent an alternate
location can be passed on the command line using the -runtime\_dir flag.

#### Default Directory (non-persistent)

Files and directories created in /run and /var/run only survive until
the next reboot. However if reboots are infrequent an easy solution
while still utilizing the default locations is to manually create the
required directories. To do this execute the following commands.

daos\_server:

-   mkdir /var/run/daos\_server

-   chmod 0755 /var/run/daos\_server

-   chown user:user /var/run/daos\_server (where user is the user you
    will run daos\_server as)

daos\_agent:

-   mkdir /var/run/daos\_agent

-   chmod 0755 /var/run/daos\_agent

-   chown user:user /var/run/daos\_agent (where user is the user you
    will run daos\_agent as)

#### Default Directory (persistent)

If the server hosting daos\_server or daos\_agent will be rebooted often
systemd provides a persistent mechanism for creating the required
directories called tmpfiles.d. This mechanism will be required every
time the system is provisioned and requires a reboot to take effect.

To tell systemd to create the necessary directories for DAOS:

-   Copy the file utils/systemd/daosfiles.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d\
    cp utils/systemd/daosfiles.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d

-   Modify the copied file to change the user and group fields
    (currently daos) to the user daos will be run as

-   Reboot the system and the directories will be created automatically
    on all subsequent reboots.

### Elevated Privileges

Several tasks (e.g. storage access, hugepages configuration) performed
by the DAOS server require elevated permissions on the storage nodes
(requiring certain commands to be run as root or with sudo).

### Storage Preparation

#### SCM

This section addresses how to verify that Optane DC Persistent memory
(DCPM) is correctly installed on the storage nodes and how to configure
it in interleaved mode to be used by DAOS in AppDirect mode.
Instructions for other type of SCM may be covered in the future.

DCPM can be configured and managed through the IpmCtl[^1] library and
associated tool. The ipmctl command just be run as root and has pretty
detailed man pages and help output (use “ipmctl help” to display it).

The list of NVDIMMs can be displayed as follows:

\$ ipmctl show -dimm

|DimmID | Capacity | HealthState | ActionRequired | LockState | FWVersion
|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|
|0x0001 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127
|0x0101 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127
|0x1001 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127
|0x1101 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127

As for affinity to CPU, use the following command:

\# ipmctl show -dimm

|DimmID | Capacity | HealthState | ActionRequired | LockState | FWVersion|
|-------|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|----------|
|0x0001 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127
|0x0101 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127
|0x1001 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127
|0x1101 | 502.5 GiB | Healthy | 0 | Disabled | 01.00.00.5127

Moreover, DAOS requires DCPM to be configured in interleaved mode. A
command mode option (--set-interleaved) can be used as a "one-shot"
invocation of *daos\_server* and must be run as root. SCM modules will
be configured into interleaved regions with memory mode set to
"app-direct" with one set per socket (each module is assigned to socket
and reports this via its NUMA rating). This configuration may require a
reboot and *daos\_server* will exit on completion of the task.

This can be done manually via the following commands:

\# to verify there is non-volatile memory type

\$ ipmctl show -a -topology | egrep 'Capac|MemoryType'

  MemoryType=DCPM

  Capacity=502.5 GiB

  MemoryType=DCPM

  Capacity=502.5 GiB

  MemoryType=DCPM

  Capacity=502.5 GiB

  \[…\]

\$ ipmctl create -goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect

A reboot is required after those changes.

#### NVMe SSDs

DAOS supports only NVMe-capable SSDs that are accessed directly from
userspace through the SPDK library.

NVMe access through SPDK as an unprivileged user can be enabled by first
running `sudo daos_server storage prep-nvme -p 4096 -u bob` (list of
PCI addresses can also be supplied to avoid unbinding all PCI devices
from the kernel, see `daos_server storage prep-nvme --help` for details).
This will perform the required setup in order for daos\_server to be run
by user "bob" who will own the hugepage mountpoint directory and vfio
groups as needed in SPDK operations. If the target-user is unspecified
(-u short option), the target user will be the issuer of the sudo command
(or root if not using sudo). The specification of hugepages (-p short
option) defines the number of huge pages to allocate for use by SPDK.

`sudo daos_server storage prep-nvme ...` command wraps the SPDK setup script
to unbind the devices from original kernel drivers and then bind the devices
to a generic driver through which SPDK can communicate. The devices can then
be bound back to the original drivers with the command
`sudo daos_server storage prep-nvme --reset`.

### Storage Detection & Selection

While the DAOS server will eventually auto-detect all the usable
storage, the administrator will still be provided the ability through
the configuration file (see next section) to whitelist or blacklist the
storage devices to be (or not) used. This section covers how to manually
detect the storage devices potentially usable by DAOS in order to
populate the configuration file when the administrator wants to have
finer control over the storage selection.

`sudo daos_server storage scan` can be used to display locally-attached SSDs
and Intel Persistent Memory Models usable by DAOS.

```
$ daos_server storage scan

[…]

Listing attached storage...

NVMe:
- id: 0
model: 'INTEL SSDPED1K375GA '
serial: 'PHKS7335006W375AGN '
pciaddr: 0000:81:00.0
fwrev: E2010420
namespace:
- id: 1
capacity: 375

SCM:
- physicalid: 28
  channel: 0
  channelpos: 1
  memctrlr: 0
  socket: 0
  capacity: 539661172736
- physicalid: 40
  channel: 0
  channelpos: 1
  memctrlr: 1
  socket: 0
  capacity: 539661172736
- physicalid: 50
  channel: 0
  channelpos: 1
  memctrlr: 0
  socket: 1
  capacity: 539661172736
- physicalid: 62
  channel: 0
  channelpos: 1
  memctrlr: 1
  socket: 1
  capacity: 539661172736
```

The pciaddr field above is what should be used in the server
configuration file to identified NVMe SSDs.

### Network Interface Detection & Selection

To display the supported OFI provider, use the following command:

\# /scratch/standan/daos\_m/opt/ofi/bin/fi\_info -l

psm2:

version: 1.7

ofi\_rxm:

version: 1.0

ofi\_rxd:

version: 1.0

verbs:

version: 1.0

UDP:

version: 1.1

sockets:

version: 2.0

tcp:

version: 0.1

ofi\_perf\_hook:

version: 1.0

ofi\_noop\_hook:

version: 1.0

shm:

version: 1.0

ofi\_mrail:

version: 1.0

The fi\_pingpong test (delivered as part of OFI/libfabric) can be used
to verify that the targeted OFI provider works fine:

node1\$ fi\_pingpong -p psm2

node2\$ fi\_pingpong -p psm2 \${IP\_ADDRESS\_NODE1}

Further details will be added to this section in a future revision.

## Server Configuration
--------------------

This section addresses how to configure the DAOS servers on the storage
nodes before starting it.

### Certificate Generation

The DAOS security framework relies on certificates to authenticate
administrators. The security infrastructure is currently under
development and will be delivered in DAOS v1.0.

### Server Configuration File

The `daos_server` configuration file is parsed when starting the
`daos_server` process. The configuration file location can be specified
on the command line (`daos_server -h` for usage) or default location
(`install/etc/daos_server.yml`).

Parameter descriptions are specified in [daos_server.yml](../../utils/config/daos_server.yml)
and example configurations files in the [examples](../../utils/config/examples)
directory.

Any option supplied to `daos_server` as a commandline option or flag will
take precedence over equivalent configuration file parameter.

For convenience, active parsed config values are written to a temporary
file for reference, location will be written to the log.

The following section lists the format, options, defaults and
descriptions available in the configuration file.

#### Configuration File Options

This section lists the default empty configuration listing all the
options (living documentation of the config file). Live examples are
available at
<https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/config>

The Location of this configuration file is determined by first checking
for the path specified through the -o option of the daos\_server command
line. Otherwise, /etc/daos\_server.conf is used.

**Name associated with the DAOS system**

Immutable after reformat.

name: daos

**Access points**

To operate, DAOS will need a quorum of access point nodes to be
available.

Immutable after reformat.

Hosts can be specified with or without port, default port below assumed
if not specified.

default: hostname of this node at port 10000 for local testing

access\_points:
\['hostname1:10001','hostname2:10001','hostname3:10001'\]

access\_points: \[hostname1,hostname2,hostname3\]

**Force default port**

Force different port number to bind daos\_server to, this will also be
used when connecting to access points if no port is specified.

default: 10000

port: 10001

**Path to CA certificate**

If not specified, DAOS will start in insecure way which means that
anybody can administrate the DAOS installation and access data.

ca\_cert: ./.daos/ca.crt

**Path to server certificate and key file**

Discarded if no CA certificate is passed.

default: ./.daos/daos\_server.{crt,key}

cert: ./.daosa/daos\_server.crt

key: ./.daosa/daos\_server.key

**Fault domain path**

Immutable after reformat.

default: /hostname for a local configuration w/o fault domain

fault\_path: /vcdu0/rack1/hostname

**Fault domain callback**

Path to executable which will return fault domain string.

Immutable after reformat.

fault\_cb: ./.daos/fd\_callback

**Use specific OFI interfaces**

Specify either a single fabric interface that will be used by all
spawned servers or a comma-separated list of fabric interfaces to be
assigned individually.

By default, the DAOS server will auto-detect and use all fabric
interfaces if any and fall back to socket on the first eth card,
otherwise.

fabric\_ifaces: \[qib0,qib1\]

**Use specific OFI provider**

Force a specific provider to be used by all the servers.

The default provider depends on the interfaces that will be
auto-detected:

ofi+psm2 for Omni-Path, ofi+verbs;ofi\_rxm for Infiniband/RoCE and
finally

ofi+socket for non-RDMA-capable Ethernet.

provider: ofi+verbs;ofi\_rxm

**Storage mount directory**

TODO: If no pre-configured mountpoins are specified, DAOS will
auto-detect NVDIMMs, configure them in interleave mode, format with ext4
and mount with the DAX extension creating a subdirectory within
scm\_mount\_path.

This option allows to specify a preferred path where the mountpoints
will be created. Either the specified directory or its parent must be a
mount point.

default: /mnt/daos

scm\_mount\_path: /mnt/daosa

**NVMe SSD whitelist**

Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses.

Immutable after reformat, colons replaced by dots in PCI identifiers.

By default, DAOS will use all the NVMe-capable SSDs that don't have
active mount points.

bdev\_include: \["0000:81:00.1","0000:81:00.2","0000:81:00.3"\]

**NVMe SSD blacklist**

Only use NVMe controllers with specific PCI addresses. Overrides drives
listed in nvme\_include and forces auto-detection to skip those drives.

Immutable after reformat, colons replaced by dots in PCI identifiers.

bdev\_exclude: \["0000:81:00.1"\]

**Use Hyperthreads**

When Hyperthreading is enabled and supported on the system, this
parameter defines whether the DAOS service thread should only be bound
to different physical cores (value 0) or hyperthreads (value 1).

default: false

hyperthreads: true

**Use the given directory for creating unix domain sockets**

DAOS Agent and DAOS Server both use unix domain sockets for
communication with other system components. This setting is the base
location to place the sockets in.

default: /var/run/daos\_server

socket\_dir: ./.daos/daos\_server

**Number of hugepages to allocate for use by NVMe SSDs**

Specifies the number (not size) of hugepages to allocate for use by NVMe
through SPDK. This indicates the total number to be used by any spawned
servers. Default system hugepage size will be used and hugepages will be
evenly distributed between CPU nodes.

default: 1024

nr\_hugepages: 4096

**Force specific debug mask for daos\_server (control plane).**

By default, just use the default debug mask used by daos\_server.

Mask specifies minimum level of message significance to pass to logger.

Currently supported values are DEBUG and ERROR.

default: DEBUG

control\_log\_mask: ERROR

**Force specific path for daos\_server (control plane) logs.**

default: print to stderr

control\_log\_file: /tmp/daos\_control.log


When per-server definitions exist, auto-allocation of resources is not
performed. Without per-server definitions, node resources will
automatically be assigned to servers based on NUMA ratings, there will
be a one-to-one relationship between servers and sockets.

## Server Startup
--------------

DAOS currently relies on PMIx for server wire-up and application to
server connection. As a result, the DAOS servers can only be started via
orterun (part of OpenMPI). A new bootstrap procedure is under
implementation and will be available for DAOS v1.0. This will remove the
dependency on PMIx and will allow the DAOS servers to be started
individually (e.g. independently on each storage node via systemd) or
collectively (e.g. pdsh, mpirun or as a Kubernetes Pod).

For further details on building and running DAOS see the
[Quickstart guide](../doc/quickstart.md).

### Parallel Launcher

As stated above, only orterun(1) is currently supported.

The list of storage nodes can be specified in a host file (referred to
as \${hostfile}). The DAOS server and the application can be started
separately but must share a URI file (referred as \${urifile}) to
connect. The \${urifile} is generated by orterun using (--report-uri
filename) at the server and used at the application with (--ompi-server
file:filename). Also, the DAOS server must be started with the
--enable-recovery option to support server failure. See the orterun(1)
man page for additional options.

To start the DAOS server, run:

orterun -np &lt;num\_servers&gt; --hostfile \${hostfile}
--enable-recovery --report-uri \${urifile} daos\_server

The --enable-recovery is required for fault tolerance to guarantee that
the fault of one server does not cause the others to be stopped.

Hostfile used here is the same as the ones used by Open MPI. See the
mpirun documentation[^3] for additional details.

The --allow-run-as-root option can be added to the command line to
allow the daos\_server to run with root priviledges on each storage
nodes (for example when needing to perform privileged tasks relating
to storage format).

### Basic Workflow

Control plane server ([daos_server](/src/control/server)) instances will
listen for requests from the management tool ([daos_shell](/src/control/dmg)),
enabling users to perform provisioning operations on network and storage
hardware remotely on storage nodes (from for example a login node).

When `daos_server` instances have been started on each storage node
for the first time, calling
`daos_shell -l <host:port>,... storage format -f` formats persistent
storage on the server node (skipping confirmation) on devices specified
in the server configuration file, then writes the superblock and
starts the data plane.

![Server format diagram](/doc/graph/server_format_flow.png)

Typically an administrator will perform the following tasks:
- Start DAOS control plane
[details](#-parallel-launcher)

- Scan Storage
`sudo daos_server storage scan`
[details](#-storage-detection-&-selection)

- Provision Storage
  - firmware update [details](#-firmware-upgrade)
  - burn-in testing [details](#-storage-burn-in)

- Amend Server config file (optional, requires subsequent restart of
`daos_server`)
[details](#-server-configuration)

- Format Storage (from any node)
`daos_shell -l <host:port>,... storage format -f`

- Create Pool (DAOS I/O - data plane - should now be running)
TODO: add instructions

### Systemd Integration

A preliminary systemd script to manage the DAOS server is available
under utils/system. That being said, this startup method is not
supported yet since the current DAOS version still relies on PMIx for
DAOS server wireup.

### Kubernetes Pod

DAOS service integration with Kubernetes is planned and will be
supported in a future DAOS version.

### Service Monitoring

On start-up, the daos\_server will create and initialize the following
components:

-   gRPC server to handle requests over client API

-   dRPC server to handle requests from IO servers over the UNIX domain
    socket

-   storage subsystems for handling interactions with NVM devices

-   SPDK environment using a shared memory segment identifier causing
    the process to act as a primary in multi-process mode. From there,
    the main process can respond to requests over the client API for
    information through the SPDK interface.

The daos\_shell is a transitory tool used to exercise the management api
and can be used to verify that the DAOS servers are up and running. It
is to be run as a standard, unprivileged user as follows:

\$ daos\_shell –l storagenode1:10001,storagenode2:10001 storage scan

“storagenode” should be replaced with the actual hostname of each
storage node. This command will show whether the DAOS server is properly
running and initialized on each storage node. A more comprehensive and
user-friendly tool built over the management API is under development. A
first version will be available for DAOS v1.0.

### Firmware Upgrade
----------------

Firmware on an NVMe controller can be updated from an image on local
storage (initially installing from a local path on the host that is
running *daos\_server* but to be extended to downloading remotely from
central storage location).

When the controller is selected and an update firmware task runs,
controller data is accessed through an existing linked list through the
binding fwupdate call and a raw command specifying firmware update with
local image (specified by filepath) and slot identifier. The firmware
update is followed by a hard reset on the controller.

### Storage Burn in
---------------

Burn-in testing can be performed on discovered NVMe controllers. By
default this involves a 15-minute slow burn-in test with a mixed
read/write workload issued by fio but test duration and load strength
should be user configurable. Burn-in should run in the background to
allow administrators to use the control-plane for other tasks in the
meantime.

The fio repo is to be built and needs to be referenced when building the
SPDK fio\_plugin. The plug-in can then be run by fio to exercise the
NVMe device through SPDK. Currently the output of the burn-in is
displayed in the shell and control is returned to the user after
completion. Future iterations may perform this as a background task.

DAOS Formatting
---------------

Distributed formatting through the DAOS servers for both SCM and SSDs is
under development and will be documented there once available.

Meanwhile, SCM should be formatted manually as an ext4 filesystem and
mounted with the dax option prior to start the DAOS servers on each
storage node:

\# Create a /dev/pmem\* device for one NUMA node

\$ ndctl create-namespace

{

  "dev":"namespace1.0",

  "mode":"fsdax",

  "map":"dev",

  "size":"2964.94 GiB (3183.58 GB)",

  "uuid":"842fc847-28e0-4bb6-8dfc-d24afdba1528",

  "raw\_uuid":"dedb4b28-dc4b-4ccd-b7d1-9bd475c91264",

  "sector\_size":512,

  "blockdev":"pmem1",

  "numa\_node":1

}

\# Show regions with 0 free space after namespace created

\$ ipmctl show -a -region

SocketID | ISetID | PersistentMemoryType | Capacity | FreeCapacity |
HealthState

================================================================================================

0x0000 | 0xb1887f48651e2ccc | AppDirect | 3012.0 GiB | 3012.0 GiB |
Healthy

0x0001 | 0xf77a7f481e352ccc | AppDirect | 3012.0 GiB | 0.0 GiB | Healthy

\$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/pmem1

\[…\]

\$ mount -o dax /dev/pmem1 /mnt/daos

If SCM is emulated with DRAM, then a tmpfs filesystem should be mounted:

\$ mount –t tmpfs –o size=16G tmpfs /mnt/daos

Replace 16G with the desired tmpfs size.

Agent Configuration
-------------------

The DAOS Agent is not required in DAOS v0.4 since authentication support
is not fully landed yet. Instructions on how to setup and start the
agent will be provided in the next revision of this document.

System Validation
-----------------

To validate that the DAOS system is properly installed, the daos\_test
suite can be executed:

[[]{#_Toc4574315 .anchor}]{#_Toc4572376 .anchor}orterun -np
&lt;num\_clients&gt; --hostfile \${hostfile} --ompi-server
file:\${urifile} ./daos\_test

daos\_test requires at least 8GB of SCM (or DRAM with tmpfs) storage on
each storage node.
