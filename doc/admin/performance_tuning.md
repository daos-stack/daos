# DAOS Performance Tuning

This section will be expanded in a future revision.

## Network Performance

Similar to the Lustre Network stack, the DAOS CART layer can validate and benchmark network communications in the same context as
an application and using the same networks/tuning options as regular
DAOS. The CART selftest can run against the DAOS servers in a production
environment in a non-destructive manner. CART selftest supports
different message sizes, bulk transfers, multiple targets, and the
following test scenarios:

-   **Selftest client to servers** where selftest issues RPCs directly
    to a list of servers

-   **Cross-servers** where selftest sends instructions to the different
    servers that will issue cross-server RPCs. This model supports a
    many to many communication model.

Instructions on how to run CART selftest will be provided in the next
revision of this document.

## Benchmarking DAOS

DAOS can be benchmarked with both IOR and mdtest through the following
backends:

-   native MPI-IO plugin combined with the ROMIO DAOS ADIO driver

-   native HDF5 plugin combined with the HDF5 DAOS connector (under
    development)

-   native POSIX plugin over dfuse and interception library (under
    development)

-   a custom DFS plugin integrating mdtest & IOR directly with libfs
    without requiring FUSE or an interception library

-   a custom DAOS plugin integrating IOR directly with the native DAOS
    array API.
