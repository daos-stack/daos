# DAOS Software Installation

DAOS runs on both Intel 64 and ARM64 platforms and has been
successfully tested on CentOS7, OpenSUSE 42.2 and Ubuntu 18.04
distributions.

## Software Dependencies

DAOS requires a C99-capable compiler, a Go compiler, and the scons
build tool. Moreover, the DAOS stack leverages the following open source
projects:

-   [*CaRT*](https://github.com/daos-stack/cart) for rank-based
    transport services that rely on
    both [*Mercury*](https://mercury-hpc.github.io/) and [*Libfabric*](https://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/) for
    lightweight network transport
    and [*PMIx*](https://github.com/pmix/master) for process set
    management. See the CaRT repository for more information on how to
    build the CaRT library.

-   [*PMDK*](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk.git) for persistent memory
    programming.

-   [*SPDK*](http://spdk.io/) for userspace NVMe device access and
    management.

-   [*FIO*](https://github.com/axboe/fio) for flexible testing of Linux
    I/O subsystems, specifically enabling validation of userspace NVMe
    device performance through fio-spdk plugin.

-   [*ISA-L*](https://github.com/01org/isa-l) for checksum and erasure
    code computation.

-   [*Argobots*](https://github.com/pmodels/argobots) for thread
    management.

The DAOS build system can be configured to download and build any
missing dependencies automatically.

## Distribution Packages

DAOS RPM packaging is under development and will be available for DAOS
v1.0. Integration with the [Spack](https://spack.io/) package manager is
also under consideration.

## DAOS Source Code

To check out the DAOS source code, run the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git

This command clones the DAOS git repository (path referred as
${daospath} below). Then initialize the submodules with:

    cd ${daospath}
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

## Building DAOS from Scratch

The below instructions have been verified with CentOS. Installations on
other Linux distributions might be similar with some variations.
Developers of DAOS may want to check additional sections below before
beginning for suggestions related specifically to development. Please
contact us in our [*forum*](https://daos.groups.io/g/daos) if running
into issues.

### Build Prerequisites

Please install the following software packages (or equivalent for other
distros):

**On CentOS and OpenSUSE:**

    yum install -y epel-release

    yum install -y git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake golang libtool scons
    boost-devel

    yum install -y libuuid-devel openssl-devel libevent-devel
    libtool-ltdl-devel

    apt-get install -y libboost-dev uuid-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev
    libltdl-dev

    apt-get install -y librdmacm-dev libcmocka0 libcmocka-dev
    libreadline6-dev

    apt-get install -y curl doxygen pandoc flex patch nasm yasm

    apt-get install -y ninja-build meson libyaml-dev python2.7-dev

    # Required SPDK packages for managing NVMe SSDs

    apt-get install -y libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev libcunit1-dev graphviz

    apt-get install -y libaio-dev sg3-utils libiscsi-dev doxygen mscgen
    libnuma-dev

    # Required IpmCtl packages for managing SCM Modules

    apt-get install -y software-properties-common

    add-apt-repository ppa:jhli/libsafec

    add-apt-repository ppa:jhli/ipmctl

    apt-get update

    apt-get install -y libipmctl-dev

Verify that all the auto tools listed below are at the appropriate
versions:

-   m4 (GNU M4) 1.4.16

-   flex 2.5.37

-   autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.69

-   automake (GNU automake) 1.13.4

-   libtool (GNU libtool) 2.4.2

### Protobuf Compiler

The DAOS control plane infrastructure will be using protobuf as the data
serialization format for its RPC requests. The DAOS proto files use
protobuf 3 syntax which is not supported by the platform protobuf
compiler in all cases. Not all developers will need to build the proto
files into the various source files. However, if changes are made to the
proto files, they will need to be regenerated with a protobuf 3.* or
higher compiler. To set up support for compiling protobuf files,
download the following precompiled package for Linux and install it
somewhere accessible by your PATH variable.

https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.5.1/protoc-3.5.1-linux-x86_64.zip

### Building DAOS & Dependencies

If all the software dependencies listed previously are already
satisfied, then type the following command in the top source directory
to build the DAOS stack:

    scons --config=force install

If you are a developer of DAOS, we recommend following the instructions
in Section 4.4.4 below.

Otherwise, the missing dependencies can be built automatically by
invoking scons with the following parameters:

    scons --config=force --build-deps=yes USE_INSTALLED=all install

By default, DAOS and its dependencies are installed under
${daospath}/install. The installation path can be modified by adding
the PREFIX= option to the above command line (e.g., PREFIX=/usr/local).

### Environment setup

Once built, the environment must be modified to search for binaries and
header files in the installation path. This step is not required if
standard locations (e.g. /bin, /sbin, /usr/lib, ...) are used.

    CPATH=${daospath}/install/include/:$CPATH
    PATH=${daospath}/install/bin/:${daospath}/install/sbin:$PATH
    export CPATH PATH

If using bash, PATH can be set up for you after a build by sourcing the
script scons_local/utils/setup_local.sh from the daos root. This
script utilizes a file generated by the build to determine the location
of daos and its dependencies.

If required, ${daospath}/install must be replaced with the alternative
path specified through PREFIX. The network type to use as well the debug
log location can be selected as follows:

    export CRT_PHY_ADDR_STR="ofi+sockets",
    OFI_INTERFACE=eth0, where eth0 is the network device you want to use.
For infiniband you could use ib0 or whichever label points to IB device.
