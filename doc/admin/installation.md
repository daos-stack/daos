# DAOS Software Installation

DAOS runs on both Intel 64 and ARM64 platforms and has been successfully tested
on CentOS7, OpenSUSE 42.2 and Ubuntu 18.04 distributions.

## Software Dependencies

DAOS requires a C99-capable compiler, a Go compiler, and the scons build tool.
Moreover, the DAOS stack leverages the following open source projects:

-   [*CaRT*](https://github.com/daos-stack/cart) for high-performance
    communication leveraging advanced network capabilities.

-   [*gRPC*](https://grpc.io/) provides an secured out-of-band channel for
    DAOS administration.

-   [*PMDK*](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk.git) for persistent memory
    programming.

-   [*SPDK*](http://spdk.io/) for userspace NVMe device access and management.

-   [*FIO*](https://github.com/axboe/fio) for flexible testing of Linux I/O
    subsystems, specifically enabling validation of userspace NVMe device
    performance through fio-spdk plugin.

-   [*ISA-L*](https://github.com/01org/isa-l) for checksum and erasure code
    computation.

-   [*Argobots*](https://github.com/pmodels/argobots) for thread management.

The DAOS build system can be configured to download and build any missing
dependencies automatically.

## Distribution Packages

DAOS RPM and deb packaging is under development and will be available for DAOS
v1.0. Integration with the [Spack](https://spack.io/) package manager is also
under consideration.

## DAOS Source Code

To check out the DAOS source code, run the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git

This command clones the DAOS git repository (path referred as ${daospath}
below). Then initialize the submodules with:

    cd ${daospath}
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

## DAOS from Scratch

The below instructions have been verified with CentOS. Installations on other
Linux distributions might be similar with some variations.
Developers of DAOS may want to check additional sections below before beginning
for suggestions related specifically to development. Please contact us in our
[*forum*](https://daos.groups.io/g/daos) if running into issues.

### Build Prerequisites

First of all, please verify that the autotools packages listed below are at the
appropriate versions (or above):
-   m4 (GNU M4) 1.4.16
-   flex 2.5.37
-   autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.69
-   automake (GNU automake) 1.13.4
-   libtool (GNU libtool) 2.4.2

Moreover, a Go version of at least 1.10 is required.

To build DAOS and its dependencies, several software packages must be installed
on the system. This includes scons, libuuid, cmocka, ipmctl and several other
packages usually available on all the Linux distributions.

A exhaustive list of packages for each supported Linux distribution is
maintained in the Docker files:
- [CentOS](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/utils/docker/Dockerfile.centos.7#L53-L72)
- [OpenSUSE](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/utils/docker/Dockerfile.leap.15#L16-L40)
- [Ubuntu](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/utils/docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu.18.04#L21-L38)

The command lines to install the required packages can be easily extracted from
the Docker files by removing the "RUN" command which is specific to Docker.
Please check the [docker](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/docker)
directory for different Linux distribution versions.

### Building DAOS & Dependencies

If all the software dependencies listed previously are already satisfied, then
type the following command in the top source directory to build the DAOS stack:

```
    scons --config=force install
```

If you are a developer of DAOS, we recommend following the instructions in the
last section of this chapter.

Otherwise, the missing dependencies can be built automatically by invoking scons
with the following parameters:

```
    scons --config=force --build-deps=yes install
```

By default, DAOS and its dependencies are installed under ${daospath}/install.
The installation path can be modified by adding the PREFIX= option to the above
command line (e.g., PREFIX=/usr/local).

### Environment setup

Once built, the environment must be modified to search for binaries and header
files in the installation path. This step is not required if standard locations
(e.g. /bin, /sbin, /usr/lib, ...) are used.

```
    CPATH=${daospath}/install/include/:$CPATH
    PATH=${daospath}/install/bin/:${daospath}/install/sbin:$PATH
    export CPATH PATH
```

If using bash, PATH can be set up for you after a build by sourcing the script
scons_local/utils/setup_local.sh from the daos root. This script utilizes a file
generated by the build to determine the location of daos and its dependencies.

If required, ${daospath}/install must be replaced with the alternative path
specified through PREFIX.

## DAOS in Docker

To build the Docker image directly from GitHub, run the following command:

```
    $ docker build -t daos -f Dockerfile.centos.7 github.com/daos-stack/daos#:utils/docker
```

This creates a CentOS7 image, fetches the latest DAOS version from GitHub and
builds it in the container. For Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, replace
Dockerfile.centos.7 with Dockerfile.ubuntu.18.04 and the appropriate version
of interest.

To build from a local tree stored on the host, a volume must be created to share
the source tree with the Docker container. To do so, please execute the following
command to create a docker image without checking out the DAOS source tree:

```
    $ docker build -t daos -f utils/docker/Dockerfile.centos.7 --build-arg NOBUILD=1 .
```

Then please execute the following command to export the DAOS source tree to the
docker container and build it:

```
    $ docker run -v ${daospath}:/home/daos/daos:Z daos /bin/bash -c "scons --config=force --build-deps=yes install"
```

${daospath} should be replaced with the full path to your DAOS source tree.

## DAOS for Development

This section covers specific instructions to create a developer-friendly
environment to contribute to the DAOS development. This includes how to
regenerate the protobuf files or add new Go package dependencies which is
only required for development purpose.

### Building DAOS for Development

For development, it is recommended to build and install each dependency in a
unique subdirectory. The DAOS build system supports this through the
TARGET\_PREFIX variable. Once the submodules have been initialized and updated,
run the following commands:

```
    scons PREFIX=${daos_prefix_path} TARGET_PREFIX=${daos_prefix_path}/opt install --build-deps=yes --config=force
```

Installing the components into seperate directories allow to upgrade the
components individually replacing --build-deps=yes with
--update-prereq={component\_name}. This requires change to the environment
configuration from before. For automated environment setup, source
scons_local/utils/setup_local.sh.

```
    ARGOBOTS=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/argobots
    CART=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/cart
    HWLOC=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/hwloc
    MERCURY=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/mercury
    PMDK=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/pmdk
    OMPI=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/ompi
    OPA=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/openpa
    PMIX=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/pmix
    FIO=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/fio
    SPDK=${daos_prefix_path}/opt/spdk

    PATH=$CART/bin/:$OMPI/bin/:${daos_prefix_path}/bin/:$PATH
```

With this approach DAOS would get built using the prebuilt dependencies in
${daos_prefix_path}/opt and required options are saved for future compilations.
So, after the first time, during development, a mere "scons --config=force" and
"scons --config=force install" would suffice for compiling changes to DAOS
source code.

If you wish to compile DAOS with clang rather than gcc, set COMPILER=clang on
the scons command line.   This option is also saved for future compilations.

### Go dependencies

Developers contributing Go code may need to change the external dependencies
located in the src/control/vendor directory. The DAOS codebase uses
[dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage these dependencies.

On EL7 and later:

```
    yum install yum-plugin-copr
    yum copr enable hnakamur/golang-dep
    yum install golang-dep
```

On Fedora 27 and later:

```
    dnf install dep
```

On Ubuntu 18.04 and later:

```
    apt-get install go-dep
```

For OSes that don't supply a package:
- Ensure that you have a personal GOPATH (see "go env GOPATH", referred to as
"$GOPATH" in this document) and a GOBIN ($GOPATH/bin) set up and included in
your PATH:

```
    mkdir -p $GOPATH/bin
    export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

- Then follow the [installation instructions on Github](https://github.com/golang/dep).

To update the vendor directory using dep after changing Gopkg.toml, first make
sure DAOS is cloned into

```
    $GOPATH/src/github.com/daos-stack/daos
```

Then:

```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/daos-stack/daos/src/control
    dep ensure
```

### Protobuf Compiler

The DAOS control plane infrastructure use protobuf as the data serialization
format for its RPC requests. The DAOS proto files use protobuf 3 syntax which is
not supported by the platform protobuf compiler in all cases. Not all developers
will need to build the proto files into the various source files.
However, if changes are made to the proto files, the corresponding C and Go
source files will need to be regenerated with a protobuf 3.\* or higher
compiler.

The recommended installation method is to clone the git repositories, check out
the tagged releases noted below, and install from source. Later versions may
work, but are not guaranteed.

- [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) v3.5.1.
  [Installation instructions](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md).
- [Protobuf-C](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c) v1.3.1.
  [Installation instructions](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/blob/master/README.md).
- gRPC plugin: [protoc-gen-go](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) v1.2.0.
  Must match the proto version in src/control/Gopkg.toml.
  Install the specific version using GIT_TAG instructions [here](https://github.com/golang/protobuf/blob/master/README.md).

Generate the Go file using the gRPC plugin. You can designate the directory
location:

```
	protoc myfile.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:<go_file_dir>
```

Generate the C files using Protobuf-C. As the header and source files in DAOS
are typically kept in separate locations, you will need to move them manually
to their destination directories:

```
	protoc-c myfile.proto --c_out=.
	mv myfile.pb-c.h <c_file_include_dir>
	mv myfile.pb-c.c <c_file_src_dir>
```
