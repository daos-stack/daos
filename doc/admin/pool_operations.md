# Pool Operations

A DAOS pool is a storage reservation that can span any storage nodes and
is managed by the administrator. The amount of space allocated to a pool
is decided at creation time and can eventually be expanded through the
management interface.

## Pool Creation/Destroy

A DAOS pool can be created and destroyed through the DAOS management API
(see daos_mgmt.h). DAOS also provides a utility called dmg to manage
storage pools from the command line.

**To create a pool:**
```bash
$ dmg pool create --scm-size=xxG --nvme-size=yyT
```

This command creates a pool distributed across the DAOS servers with a
target size on each server with xxGB of SCM and yyTB of NVMe storage.
The actual space allocated will be a base-2 representation for SCM
(i.e., 20GB will be interpreted as 20GiB == `20*2^30` bytes) and base-10
representation for NVMe (i.e. 20GB will be interpreted as `20*10^9`
bytes) following the convention of units for memory and storage capacity.
The UUID allocated to the newly created pool is printed to stdout
(referred to as ${puuid}) as well as the rank where the pool service is
located (referred to as ${svcl}).

```bash
$ dmg pool create --help
...
[create command options]
      -g, --group=     DAOS pool to be owned by given group, format name@domain
      -u, --user=      DAOS pool to be owned by given user, format name@domain
      -a, --acl-file=  Access Control List file path for DAOS pool
      -s, --scm-size=  Size of SCM component of DAOS pool
      -n, --nvme-size= Size of NVMe component of DAOS pool
      -r, --ranks=     Storage server unique identifiers (ranks) for DAOS pool
      -v, --nsvc=      Number of pool service replicas (default: 1)
      -S, --sys=       DAOS system that pool is to be a part of (default: daos_server)
```

The typical output of this command is as follows:

```bash
$ dmg -i pool create -s 1G -n 10G -g root -u root -S daos
Active connections: [localhost:10001]
Creating DAOS pool with 1GB SCM and 10GB NvMe storage (0.100 ratio)
Pool-create command SUCCEEDED: UUID: 5d6fa7bf-637f-4dba-bcd2-480ad251cdc7,
Service replicas: 0,1
```

This created a pool with UUID 5d6fa7bf-637f-4dba-bcd2-480ad251cdc7,
two pool service replica on rank 0 and 1.

**To destroy a pool:**

```bash
$ dmg pool destroy --pool=${puuid}
```
**To evict handles/connections to a pool:**

```bash
$ dmg pool evict --pool=${puuid}
`

**To see a list of the pools in your DAOS system:**

```bash
$ dmg system list-pools
```

This will return a table of pool UUIDs and the ranks of their pool service
replicas. For example:

```bash
$ dmg system list-pools
localhost:10001: connected
Pool UUID				Svc Replicas
---------				------------
2a8ec3b2-729b-4617-bf51-77f37f764194	0,1
a106d667-5c5d-4d6f-ac3a-89099196c41a	0
85141a07-e3ba-42a6-81c2-3f18253c5e47	0
```

## Pool Properties

At creation time, a list of pool properties can be specified through the
API (not supported by the tool yet):

| **Pool Property**        | **Description** |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| `DAOS_PROP_PO_LABEL`<img width=80/>| A string that the administrator can associate with a pool.  e.g., project A, project B, IO500 test pool|
| `DAOS_PROP_PO_ACL`       | Access control list (ACL) associated with the pool|
| `DAOS_PROP_PO_SPACE_RB`  | Space reserved on each target for rebuild purpose|
| `DAOS_PROP_PO_SELF_HEAL` | Define whether the pool wants automatically-trigger or manually-triggered self-healing|
| `DAOS_PROP_PO_RECLAIM`   | Tune space reclaim strategy based on time interval, batched commits or snapshot creation|

While those pool properties are currently stored persistently with pool
metadata, many of them are still under development. Moreover, the
ability to modify some of those properties on an existing pool will
be provided in a future release.

## Access Control Lists

Client user and group access for pools are controlled by
[Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://daos-stack.github.io/overview/security/#access-control-lists).
Most pool-related tasks are performed using the DMG administrative tool, which
is authenticated by the administrative certificate rather than user-specific
credentials.

Access-controlled client pool accesses include:

* Connecting to the pool.

* Querying the pool.

* Creating containers in the pool.

* Deleting containers in the pool.

This is reflected in the set of supported
[pool permissions](https://daos-stack.github.io/overview/security/#permissions).

A user must be able to connect to the pool in order to access any containers
inside, regardless of their permissions on those containers.

### Ownership

Pool ownership conveys no special privileges for access control decisions. All
desired privileges of the owner-user (`OWNER@`) and owner-group (`GROUP@`) must
be explicitly defined by an administrator in the pool ACL.

### Creating a pool with a custom ACL

To create a pool with a custom ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool create --scm-size <size> --acl-file <path>
```

The ACL file format is detailed in the [here](https://daos-stack.github.io/overview/security/#acl-file).

### Displaying a Pool's ACL

To view a pool's ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool get-acl --pool <UUID>
```

The output is in the same string format used in the ACL file during creation,
with one Access Control Entry (i.e., ACE) per line.

### Modifying a Pool's ACL

For all of these commands using an ACL file, the ACL file must be in the format
noted above for pool creation.

#### Overwriting the ACL

To replace a pool's ACL with a new ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool overwrite-acl --pool <UUID> --acl-file <path>
```

#### Adding and Updating ACEs

To add or update multiple entries in an existing pool ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool update-acl --pool <UUID> --acl-file <path>
```

To add or update a single entry in an existing pool ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool update-acl --pool <UUID> --entry <ACE>
```

If there is no existing entry for the principal in the ACL, the new entry is
added to the ACL. If there is already an entry for the principal, that entry
is replaced with the new one.

#### Removing an ACE

To delete an entry for a given principal in an existing pool ACL:

```bash
$ dmg pool delete-acl --pool <UUID> --principal <principal>
```

The principal corresponds to the principal portion of an ACE that was
set during pool creation or a previous pool ACL operation. For the delete
operation, the principal argument must be formatted as follows:

* Named user: `u:username@`
* Named group: `g:groupname@`
* Special principals: `OWNER@`, `GROUP@`, and `EVERYONE@`

The entry for that principal will be completely removed. This does not always
mean that the principal will have no access. Rather, their access to the pool
will be decided based on the remaining ACL rules.

## Pool Query
The pool query operation retrieves information (i.e., the number of targets,
space usage, rebuild status, property list, and more) about a created pool. It
is integrated into the dmg utility.

**To query a pool:**

```bash
$ dmg pool query --pool <UUID>
```

Below is the output for a pool created with SCM space only.

```bash
    pool=47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a
    Pool 47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a, ntarget=64, disabled=8
    Pool space info:
    - Target(VOS) count:56
    - SCM:
        Total size: 28GB
        Free: 28GB, min:505MB, max:512MB, mean:512MB
    - NVMe:
        Total size: 0
        Free: 0, min:0, max:0, mean:0
    Rebuild done, 10 objs, 1026 recs
```

The total and free sizes are the sum across all the targets whereas
min/max/mean gives information about individual targets. A min value
close to 0 means that one target is running out of space.

The example below shows a rebuild in progress and NVMe space allocated.

```bash
    pool=95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671
    Pool 95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671, ntarget=64, disabled=8
    Pool space info:
    - Target(VOS) count:56
    - SCM:
        Total size: 28GB
        Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB
    - NVMe:
        Total size: 56GB
        Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB
    Rebuild busy, 75 objs, 9722 recs
```

Additional status and telemetry data are planned to be exported through
the management API and tool and will be documented here once available.

## Pool Modifications

### Target Exclusion and Self-Healing

## Pool Exclude

An operator can exclude one or more targets from a specific DAOS pool using the rank
the target resides on as well as the target idx on that rank. If a target idx list is
not provided then all targets on the rank will be excluded. Excluding a target will
automatically start the rebuild process.

**To exclude a target from a pool:**

```bash
$ dmg pool exclude --pool=${puuid} --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3}
```

The pool target exclude command accepts 3 parameters:

* The pool UUID of the pool that the targets will be excluded from.
* The rank of the target(s) to be excluded.
* The target Indices of the targets to be excluded from that rank (optional).

## Pool Drain

Alternatively when an operator would like to remove one or more pool targets
without the system operating in degraded mode Drain can be used. A pool drain operation will
initiate rebuild without excluding the designated target until after the rebuild is complete.
This allows the target(s) drained to continue to perform I/O while the rebuild
operation is ongoing. Drain additionally enables non-replicated data to be
rebuilt onto another target whereas in a conventional failure scenario non-replicated
data would not be integrated into a rebuild and would be lost.

**To drain a target from a pool:**

```bash
$ dmg pool drain --pool=${puuid} --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3}
```

The pool target drain command accepts 3 parameters:

* The pool UUID of the pool that the targets will be drained from.
* The rank of the target(s) to be drained.
* The target Indices of the targets to be drained from that rank (optional).

### Target Reintegration

After a target failure an operator can fix the underlying issue and reintegrate the
affected targets to restore the pool to its original state. The operator can either
reintegrate specific targets for a rank by supplying a target idx list, or reintegrate
an entire rank by omitting the list.

```
$ dmg pool reintegrate --pool=${puuid} --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3}
```

The pool reintegrate command accepts 3 parameters:

* The pool UUID of the pool that the targets will be reintegrated into.
* The rank of the affected targets.
* The target Indices of the targets to be reintegrated on that rank (optional).

When rebuild is triggered it will list the operations and their related targets by their rank ID
and target index.

```
Target (rank 5 idx 0) is down.
Target (rank 5 idx 1) is down.
...
(rank 5 idx 0) is excluded.
(rank 5 idx 1) is excluded.
```

These should be the same values used when reintegrating the targets.

```
$ dmg pool reintegrate --pool=${puuid} --rank=5 --target-idx=0,1
```

### Pool Extension

#### Target Addition & Space Rebalancing

Full Support for online target addition and automatic space rebalancing is
planned for DAOS v1.4 and will be documented here once available.

Until then the following command(s) are placeholders and offer limited
functionality related to Online Server Addition/Rebalancing operations.

An operator can choose to extend a pool to include ranks not currently in the pool.
This will automatically trigger a server rebalance operation where objects within the extended
pool will be rebalanced across the new storage.

```
$ dmg pool extend --pool=${puuid} --ranks=${rank1},${rank2}...
```

The pool extend command accepts 2 required parameters:

* The pool UUID of the pool to be extended.
* A comma separated list of server ranks to include in the pool.

The pool rebalance operation will work most efficiently when the pool is extended to its desired
size in a single operation, as opposed to multiple, small extensions.

#### Pool Shard Resize

Support for quiescent pool shard resize is currently not supported and
is under consideration.

## Pool Catastrophic Recovery

A DAOS pool is instantiated on each target by a set of pmemobj files
managed by PMDK and SPDK blobs on SSDs. Tools to verify and repair this
persistent data is scheduled for DAOS v2.4 and will be documented here
once available.

Meanwhile, PMDK provides a recovery tool (i.e., pmempool check) to verify
and possibly repair a pmemobj file. As discussed in the previous section, the
rebuild status can be consulted via the pool query and will be expanded
with more information.
