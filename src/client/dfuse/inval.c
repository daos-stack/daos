/* Evict inodes based on timeout.
 *
 * The goal here is to have dfuse release resources over time, rather than the default which would
 * be the kernel keeps a reference on everything until there's memory pressure (effectively
 * forever) then instruct the kernel to forget things which have expired.
 *
 * This reduces both kernel memory and dfuse memory, keeps the hash table much smaller and allows
 * dfuse to close containers and disconnect from pools, meaning that at idle dfuse resource
 * consumption tends to zero.
 *
 * For kernel based filesystems there is a benefit to keeping all this data in memory as it can
 * simply be re-validated before use however with fuse + DAOS then re-validate is the same cost
 * as lookup so there is no benefit in keeping this data around.
 *
 * Maintain a number of lists for inode timeouts, for each timeout value keep a list of inodes
 * that are using that value, when a inode is refreshed by the kernel then move the inode to the end
 * of the correct list.
 *
 * Separately have a thread which periodically will walk each list starting at the front and
 * invalidate any entries where the timeout has expired.
 *
 * In this way the lists are never traversed, on access a entry is removed from where it is and
 * appended to the end, and the timeout starts at the front of the list and traverses only as far
 * as it needs to until the front entry is to be kept.
 *
 * As lookups will not be repeated by the kernel until after timeout has expired allow some leeway
 * before eviction to allow re-validation of in-use datasets without triggering entire tree
 * invalidations through the kernel.  Directories get five seconds, anything else two.  Ideally
 * directories would be invalidated first as this would result in less dfuse->kernel calls as once
 * the kernel invalidates directories then it invalidates the whole tree below that, however there
 * are also use-cases where there are significiant numbers of files per directory where the
 * directory is in active use but individual files are not.
 *
 * Future work might be to speculatively perform lookups close to the end of the timeout period,
 * then if a entry was in frequent use it's lookup could be performed from memory, effectively
 * moving the re-validation cost off the critical path.  This code currently only handles dentries
 * but could also separately track attributes (inodes) and file contents as well.
 *
 * Additional changes to consider in the future could include:
 *  Better handing of eviction timeouts, "max(time * 1.1, 10)" would be better than a flat +x/+5
 *  Use arrays rather than lists for the buckets for faster iteration.
 *  Reference counting the timeout buckets.
 *
 * Locking: The ival_lock is contended, it is accessed several places, however none do any more
 * than list management.  As inodes might be removed from one list and re-inserted into another
 * there is a pre subsystem lock rather than per list locks.
 *  ie_close() which is called from forget and some failure paths in readdir()
 *  lookup() to move entries to the end of this list.
 *  de_run() to pull items from the front of the list.
 *
 * Wakeup: The invalidation thread is woken up when:
 *  dfuse is exiting.
 *  something is added to an empty list.
 *  after a timeout.
 * Timeouts are chosen based on the entries still on any list, dfuse will sleep as long as it can
 * but at least 2 seconds and at most 60.
 * As this relates to releasing resources there is no additional benefit in finer grained time
 * control than this.
