# DAOS Client Library

The DAOS API is divided along several functionalities to address the different
features that DAOS exposes:
- Management API: pool and target management
- Pool Client API: pool access
- Container API: container management and access, container snapshots
- Transaction API: transaction model and concurrency control
- Object, Array and KV APIs: object and data management and access
- Event, Event Queue, and Task API: non-blocking operations
- Addons API: array and KV operations built over the DAOS object API
- DFS API: DAOS file system API to emulate a POSIX namespace over DAOS
- DUNS API: DAOS unified namespace API for integration with an existing system
  namespace.

Each of those components have associated README.md files that provide more
details about the functionality they support except for APIs to support
non-blocking operations which is discussed here.

The libdaos API is available under [/src/include/daos\_\*](/src/include/) and
associated man pages under [/doc/man/man3/](/doc/man/man3/).

## Event & Event Queue

DAOS API functions can be used in either blocking or non-blocking mode. This is
determined through a pointer to a DAOS event passed to each API call that:

- if NULL indicates that the operation is to be blocking. The operation will
  return after completing the operation. The error codes for all failure cases
  will be returned through the return code of the API function itself.

- if a valid event is used, the operation will run in non-blocking mode and
  return immediately after scheduling the operation in the internal scheduler
  and after RPCs are submitted to the underlying stack. The return value of the
  operation is success if the scheduling succeeds, but does not indicate that
  the actual operation succeeds. The errors that can be caught on return are
  either invalid parameters or scheduling problems. The actual return code of
  the operation will be available in the event error code (event.ev_error) when
  the event completes.

A valid event to be used must be created first with a separate API call. To
allow users to track multiple events at a time, an event can be created as part
of an event queue, which is basically a collection of events that can be
progressed and polled together. Alternatively, an event can be created without
an event queue, and be tracked individually. Once an event is completed, it can
re-used for another DAOS API call to minimize the need for event creation and
allocations inside the DAOS library.

## Task Engine Integration

The DAOS Task API provides an alternative way to use the DAOS API in a
non-blocking manner and at the same time build a task dependency tree between
DAOS API operation. This is useful for applications and middleware libraries
using DAOS and needing to build a schedule of DAOS operations with dependencies
between each other (N-1, 1-N, N-N).

To leverage the task API, the user would need to create a scheduler where DAOS
tasks can be created as a part of. The task API is generic enough to allow the
user to mix DAOS specific tasks (through the DAOS task API) and other user
defined tasks and add dependencies between those.

documentation](/src/common/README.md) for more details.
