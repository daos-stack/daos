# PMFS Overview

PMFS is designed for single node over VOS without replica,
and it can be combined with other DB (i.e.: RocksDB).

PMFS stands for Persistent Memory VOS File System. The PMFS API provides an encapsulated
namespace with a POSIX-like API directly on top of the VOS API. The namespace is
encapsulated under a single VOS container, where directories and files are
objects in that container.

The encapsulated namespace will be located in one VOS Pool and a single VOS
Container. The user provides a valid (connected) pool handle and an open
container handle where the namespace will be located.

## PMFS Threading Model

PMFS uses APIs that provided by vos target that are receiving fs commands as async tasks
in spdk tasks' rings.

we can process different tasks in a ring that enqueued by the inputting commands.
PMFS target will drain the rings and process them one by one.

## PMFS Namespace

When the file system is created (i.e. when the VOS container is initialized as
an encapsulated namespace), a reserved object (with a predefined object ID) will
be added to the container and will record superblock (SB) information about the
namespace. The SB object has the reserved OID 0.0. The object class is
determined either through the oclass parameter passed to container creation or
through automatic selection based on container properties such as the redundancy
factor.

The SB object contains an entry with a magic value to indicate it is a POSIX
filesystem. The SB object will contain also an entry to the root directory of
the filesystem, which will be another reserved object with a predefined OID
(1.0) and will have the same representation as a directory (see next
section). The OID of the root id will be inserted as an entry in the superblock
object.

The SB will look like this:

~~~~
D-key: "PMFS_SB_METADATA"
A-key: "PMFS_MAGIC"
single-value (uint64_t): SB_MAGIC (0xda05df50da05df50)

A-key: "PMFS_SB_VERSION"
single-value (uint16_t): Version number of the SB. This is used to determine the layout of the SB
			 (the DKEYs and value sizes).

A-key: "PMFS_LAYOUT_VERSION"
single-value (uint16_t): This is used to determine the format of the entries in the PMFS namespace
			(PMFS to VOS mapping).

A-key: "PMFS_SB_FEAT_COMPAT"
single-value (uint64_t): flags to indicate feature set like extended attribute support, indexing

A-key: "PMFS_SB_FEAT_INCOMPAT"
single-value (uint64_t): flags

A-key: "PMFS_SB_MKFS_TIME"
single-value (uint64_t): time when PMFS namespace was created

A-key: "PMFS_SB_STATE"
single-value (uint64_t): state of FS (clean, corrupted, etc.)

A-key: "PMFS_CHUNK_SIZE"
single-value (uint64_t): Default chunk size for files in this container

A-key: "PMFS_FILE_SIZE"
single-value (uint64_t): Default file size for files in this container

D-key: "/"
// rest of akey entries for root are same as in directory entry described below.
~~~~~~

## PMFS Directories

A POSIX directory will map to a VOS object with multiple dkeys, where each dkey
will correspond to an entry in that directory (for another subdirectory, regular
file, or symbolic link). The dkey value will be the entry name in that
directory. The dkey will contain an akey with all attributes of that entry in a
byte array serialized format. Extended attributes will each be stored in a
single value under a different akey. The mapping table will look like this
(includes two extended attributes: xattr1, xattr2):

~~~~~~
Directory Object
  D-key "entry1_name"
    A-key "PMFS_INODE"
      RECX (byte array starting at idx 0):
        mode_t: permission bit mask + type of entry
        oid: object id of entry
        atime: access time
        mtime: modify time
        ctime: change time
        chunk_size: chunk_size of file (0 if default or not a file)
        file_szie: file size of all files
	syml: symlink value (does not exist if not a symlink)
    A-key "x:xattr1"	// extended attribute name (if any)
    A-key "x:xattr2"	// extended attribute name (if any)
~~~~~~

The extended attributes are all prefixed with "x:".

This summarizes the mapping of a directory testdir with a file, directory, and
symlink:

~~~~~~
testdir$ ls
dir1
file1
syml1 -> dir1

Object testdir
  D-key "dir1"
    A-key "mode" , permission bits + S_IFDIR
    A-key "oid" , object id of dir1
    ...
  D-key "file1"
    A-key "mode" , permission bits + S_IFREG
    A-key "oid" , object id of file1
    ...
  D-key "syml1"
    A-key "mode" , permission bits + S_IFLNK
    A-key "oid" , empty
    A-key "syml", dir1
    ...
~~~~~~

## Files

As shown in the directory mapping above, the entry of a file will be inserted in
its parent directory object with an object ID that corresponds to that file. The
object ID for a regular file will be of a VOS array object, which itself is a
VOS object with some properties (the element size and chunk size). In the
POSIX file case, the cell size will always be 1 byte. The chunk size can be set
at create time only, with the default being 1 MB. The array object itself is
mapped onto a VOS object with integer dkeys, where each dkey contains
chunk_size elements. So for example, if we have a file with size 10 bytes, and
chunk size is 3 bytes, the array object will contain the following:

~~~~
Object array
  D-key 0
    A-key NULL , array elements [0,1,2]
  D-key 1
    A-key NULL , array elements [3,4,5]
  D-key 2
    A-key NULL , array elements [6,7,8]
  D-key 3
    A-key NULL , array elements [9]
~~~~~~

For more information about the array object layout, please refer to the
README.md file for Array Addons.

## Symbolic Links

As mentioned in the directory section, symbolic links will not have an object
for the symlink itself, but will have a value in the entry itself of the parent
directory containing the actual value of the symlink.

## Access Permissions

All PMFS objects (files, directories, and symlinks) inherit the access
permissions of the PMFS container that they are created with. So the permission
checks are done on pmfs_mount(). If that succeeds and the user has access to the
container, then they will be able to access all objects in the PMFS
namespace.

setuid(), setgid() programs, supplementary groups, ACLs are not supported in the
PMFS namespace.
