 * These information will be used for DTX recovery as following:
 *
 * During DTX recovery, for a non-committed DTX, its new leader queries with
 * other alive participants for such DTX status. If all alive ones reply the
 * new leader with 'prepared', then before making the decision to commit the
 * DTX, we need to handle some corner cases:
 *
 * Some corrupted DTX participant may have ever refused (because of conflict
 * with other DTX that may be committed or may be not) related modification.
 * But it did not reply to the old leader before its corruption, or did but
 * the old leader crashed before abort such DTX. If the case happened on all
 * members in some modification group, then when DTX recovery, nobody knows
 * there have ever been DTX conflict. Under such case, the new leader should
 * NOT commit such DTX, otherwise, it will break DAOS transaction semantics
 * for other conflict DTXs. On the other hand, abort such DTX is also NOT a
 * safe solution, because it is possible that the corrupted DTX participant
 * may have committed such DTX before its (and the old leader) corruption.
 *
 * So once we detect some group corruption or lost during the DTX recovery,
 * we can neither commit nor abort related DTX to avoid further damage the
 * system. Instead, we can mark it with some flags and introduce more human
 * knowledge to recover it sometime later.
