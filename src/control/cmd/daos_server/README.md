# DAOS Server

The DAOS Server (control plane) can be run either as a foreground process to
issue hardware provisioning commands or as a background process (binary name
followed by the "start" subcommand) when it will listen for instructions from
the [management tool](/src/control/cmd/dmg/README.md) and manage bring-up of
the DAOS system.
A DAOS Server instance will typically be run on every storage node to
orchestrate the operation of the managed DAOS Engine processes.

## Network and Storage Management

The DAOS Engine (data plane) utilizes two forms of non-volatile storage;
storage class memory (SCM) in the form of persistent memory modules and NVMe in
the form of high-performance SSDs.

The DAOS Server provides capability to provision and manage network devices and
non-volatile storage including the allocation of resources to engine instances.

See
[admin guide](https://docs.daos.io/latest/admin/deployment/#hardware-provisioning)
for details on hardware provisioning.

## Configuration

A server configuration file contains details of global and per-engine
parameters related to hardware devices and environments.

### Configuration File

A populated `daos_server` config file is required when starting `daos_server`
process, its location can be specified on the commandline (`-o` option) or
default location (`<daos install dir>/etc/daos_server.yml`).

Example config files can be found in the
[examples folder](/utils/config/examples).

Config file parameters will be parsed and populated with defaults as documented
in the [default daos server config](/utils/config/daos_server.yml).

Parameters passed to `daos_server` on the commandline as application options
(excluding environment variables) take precedence over values specified in
config file and for convenience, active parsed config values are written to the
directory where the server config file was read from or `/tmp/` if that fails.

It is strongly recommended to specify all parameters and environment for
running DAOS servers in the [server config file](/utils/config/daos_server.yml).

NOTES:
* some environment variables can only be supplied to `daos_engine` instances
through the server config file:
	* `CRT_PHY_ADDR_STR`, `OFI_INTERFACE`, `OFI_PORT`, `D_LOG_MASK`,
`D_LOG_FILE`
* while it is very highly recommended to use the server config file as a means
to supply parameters, environment variables not applied through the config file
but specified in the calling environment will still be present in the
environment used to launch `daos_engine`.

### Logging

Log file and level mask for both data (`daos_engine`) and control
(`daos_server`) planes can be set in the server config file.

### NVMe/block-device storage

Parameters prefixed with `bdev_` in the per-engine section of the config file
determine how NVMe storage will be assigned for use by DAOS on the storage
node.
Examples for NVMe and AIO (emulation) classes including config file syntax can
be found in the [examples folder](/utils/config/examples).

### SCM/pmem storage

Parameters prefixed with `scm_` in the per-engine section of the config file
determine how SCM storage will be assigned for use by DAOS on the storage node.
Examples for both DCPM and RAM (emulation) SCM classes including config file
syntax can be found in the [examples folder](/utils/config/examples).

## Certificates

If the system is set up in normal mode (not insecure mode), the server will
have been configured with a certificate with the CommonName "server" to
identify itself and attest the validity of user credentials.

For more details on how certificates are used within DAOS, see the
[Security documentation](/src/control/security/README.md#certificate-usage-in-daos).

For details on how gRPC communications are secured and authenticated, see the
[Security documentation](/src/control/security/README.md#host-authentication-with-certificates).

## Data Plane Communication

I/O Engine processes communicate with the DAOS Server using UNIX Domain Sockets
set up on the storage node.

### UNIX Domain Socket

The default directory used for the UNIX Domain Sockets is
`/var/run/daos_server`. Alternately, a directory may be specified in the server
configuration file. The directory must exist, and the user starting the server
process must have write access to it in order for the server to start up
successfully. The server opens the socket and proceeds to listen for
communications from local I/O Engine processes.

### dRPC

The protocol used to communicate between the DAOS Server and I/O Engine processes
is [dRPC](/src/control/drpc/README.md). DAOS Servers and Engines are both capable
of acting as dRPC server or client.

## Management Tool Communication

Communications between the [management tool](/src/control/cmd/dmg/README.md)
and the DAOS Server occur over the management network, via the gRPC protocol.
Management requests can be made to operate over resources local to specific
storage nodes or to operate over the distributed DAOS system.
When issuing `dmg` commands that operate over the DAOS system, requests are
directed to the management service leader which is capable of handling them.
The control API is responsible for working out which `daos_server` instance
is the MS leader and issuing the request, `dmg` uses the control API.
The `dmg` tool requires the hostlist of all hosts in the DAOS system to be
specified either on the command line or in the `daos_control.yml` config file.
A list of access point servers is defined in the server's config file.

## Functionality

The functions provided by the server include:

- Storage and Network hardware provisioning and formatting.
- Hardware resource allocation between engine instances.
- Formatting and monitoring of engine instances.
- Controlled start and stop of managed engine instances.
- Storage pool management including creation, property handling and
destruction.

## Subcommands

Subcommands use the `go-flags` framework for commandline handling.
Commandline and configuration file options are handled in `main.go` and
`config.go`.
`daos_server` supports various subcommands (see `daos_server --help` for
available subcommands) which will perform stand-alone tasks (e.g.  `storage
prepare|scan`).
To attempt to bring-up the engine(s), use the `start` subcommand which is
defined in `start.go`.
Storage specific subcommands are defined within `start.go` and network
specific sub commands are defined within `network.go`.

### Storage Prepare

Preparing NVMe consists of binding SSD controllers to a driver (usually UIO or
VFIO) which makes it available for communication via the SPDK framework (and
unavailable to the OS).

Preparing SCM involves configuring DCPM modules in AppDirect memory regions
(interleaved mode) in groups of modules local to a specific socket (NUMA) and
resultant nvdimm namespaces are defined by a device identifier (e.g.
/dev/pmem0).

See `daos_server storage prepare --help` and the
[admin guide](https://docs.daos.io/latest/admin/deployment/#hardware-provisioning) for usage.

### Storage Scan

Device details for any discovered NVMe SSDs accessible through SPDK on the
storage server will be returned when running `storage scan` subcommand.

Device details for any discovered PMem (Intel(R) Optane(TM) persistent memory)
modules on the storage server will be returned when running the `storage scan`
subcommand.

See `daos_server storage scan --help` and the
[admin guide](https://docs.daos.io/latest/admin/deployment/)
for usage.

### Network Scan

See `daos_server network scan --help`.
