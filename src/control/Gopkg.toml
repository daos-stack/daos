# This file defines the dependencies for the Go language control plane code.
# In general we pin to a minor version or release branch, with the assumption
# that backwards compatibility won't be broken in a patch release.

# Running "dep ensure" will pull the latest versions that satisfy the
# constraints outlined here, and put them into the vendor directory.
