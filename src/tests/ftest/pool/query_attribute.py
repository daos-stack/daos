    """Test class for daos pool query and attribute tests.

    Test Class Description:
        Query test: Create a pool and call daos pool query. From the output,
        verify the UUID matches the one that was returned when creating the
        pool. Also verify the pool size against the value that's passed in to
        dmg pool create.

        Attribute test:
        1. Create 5 attributes to a pool. We can set attribute
        name and corresponding value, so set unique name-value pair for each of
        the 5 attributes.
        2. Call pool list-attr. This returns the 5 attribute names, so compare
        them against the actual names used.
        3. Call pool get-attr. This returns the value of the corresponding
        name, so do this for each of the 5 attributes.
