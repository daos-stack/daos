    Test to create pools on single, multiple, and dynamically added server.

    This test covers the following requirements.
    SRS-10-0054: New server can be used for new pool.
    SRS-10-0105: A pool spanning only a subset of the servers can be created
    starting from 1 server up to all the servers. Query should be used to verify
    that the pool was allocated on the requested servers.

    First, we'll create one pool on the first server and another pool over two
    servers. This covers SRS-10-0105.

    Second, we start a new server and let it join the existing two servers.
    Then we'll create one pool on this new server and another one over all three
    servers. This covers SRS-10-0054.
