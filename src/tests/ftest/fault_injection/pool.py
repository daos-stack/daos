        Using CaRT as test pool services is a good way to add noise to the
        tools, however there are other ways to simulate a flaky network
        connection.

        The happy path steps are:
            Backup iptables rules
            Block network access to the interface used by daos
            Attempt to create containers
            Create containers fail
            Restore iptables rules

        Simulating a failing network connection:
            Backup iptables rules
            Block network access to the interface used by daos
            Attempt to create containers
            While the previous command is running,  Restore iptables rules
            Daos tool should create container

        Why this test is not being automated:

            1) Not all fabric hardware support IPoIB
            2) If there is no fabric hw, at least 2 ethernet devices are
               required, this is to avoid losing connection to the host.

        Details and how to:

        First of all, a backup of the current iptables rules is required:

            sudo iptables-save > savedrules.txt

        To restore the backup:

            sudo iptables-restore < savedrules.txt

        If ib0 interface is not enabled:
            1) Make sure the fabric hardware supports IPoIB
            2) sudo modprobe ib_ipoib
            3) Verify the ibX interface is listed: ip -a
            4) Use the IPV4 ip to be used to block the network traffic

        How to block the access:

            sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.100.64 -j DROP

            Where:
                192.168.100.64 is the ib0 network interface
                It could be an ethernet interface, just make sure it is not the
                same interface used for remote connection. If there is access
                through serial console, you may as well use a single eth device.

            Note:
                Blocking using ip port did not prevent daos to create conts:
                sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.100.64 -p tcp
                              --destination-port 10001 -j DROP

                    The rules for OUTPUT, tcp and udp combinations were also
                    tried.

        Once iptables has the traffic blocked, attempt to create containers.
        It should fail.

        Afterwards, the idea is to turn on and off the iptable rules to simulate
        a failing network connection, daos tool should re-attempt the failed
        request. This could be coded as:
            A thread/process turning on and off the iptable rules
            A thread/process creating containers

        The test can be extended to other dmg/daos operations.
