            Purpose of this test is to run ior through dfuse with

            library on 1 client for at least 30 minutes and verify the
            data integrity using ior's Read Verify and Write Verify
            options.

        Use case:
            Run ior with read, write, fpp, read verify
            write verify for 30 minutes
            Run ior with read, write, read verify
            write verify for 30 minutes
