        Test Description:
            Purpose of this test is to run ior through dfuse in multiple
            clients for 5 minutes and capture the metrics and use the
            intercepiton library by exporting LD_PRELOAD to the libioil.so
            path and rerun the above ior and capture the metrics and
            compare the performance difference and check using interception
            library make significant performance improvement.

        Use case:
            Run ior with read, write for 5 minutes
            Run ior with read, write for 5 minutes with interception library
            Compare the results and check whether using interception
                library provides better performance.
