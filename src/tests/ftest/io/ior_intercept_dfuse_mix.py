        Test Description:
            Purpose of this test is to run ior through dfuse on 4 clients
            for 5 minutes and capture the metrics and use the
            intercepiton library by exporting LD_PRELOAD to the libioil.so
            path on 3 clients and leave 1 client to use dfuse and rerun
            the above ior and capture the metrics and compare the
            performance difference and check using interception
            library make significant performance improvement. Verify the
            client didn't use the interception library doesn't show any
            improvement.

        Use case:
            Run ior with read, write for 5 minutes
            Run ior with read, write for 5 minutes with interception
            library

            Compare the results and check whether using interception
                library provides better performance and not using it
                does not change the performance.
