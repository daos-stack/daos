        Test Description:

            containers using fio.
        Use cases:
            Mount dfuse using pool uuid.
            Create multiple containers under that dfuse mount point.
            Check those containers are accessible from that mount point.
            Perform io to those containers using FIO
            Delete one of the containers
            Check if dfuse is still running. If not, fail the test and exit.
            Otherwise, try accessing the deleted container.
            This should fail.
            Check dfuse again.
