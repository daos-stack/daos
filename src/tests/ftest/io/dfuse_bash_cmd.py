        Test Description:
            Purpose of this test is to mount different mount points of dfuse
            for different container and pool sizes and perform basic bash
            commands.

        Use cases:
            Following list of bash commands have been incorporated
            as part of this test: mkdir, touch, ls, chmod, rm, dd, stat,
            cp, cmp, mv, rmdir.
              Create a directory.
              Create a file under that directory.
              List the created file.
              Remove the file.
              Write a file to the dfuse mounted location using dd.
              List the written file to verify if it's create.
              Verify the file created is of right size as desired.
              Copy the file
              Compare the copied file with original to verify the
              content is same.
              Remove copied file.
              Rename file
              Verify renamed file exist using list.
              Remove a directory
