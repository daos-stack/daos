            Run ior with read, write, CheckWrite, CheckRead in ssf mode.
            Run ior with read, write, CheckWrite, CheckRead in fpp mode.
            Run ior with read, write, CheckWrite and access to random
                offset instead of sequential.
            All above three cases to be run with single client and
                multiple client processes in two separate nodes.
