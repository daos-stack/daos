        Test Description:
            Purpose of this test is to mount dfuse and verify aggregation
            to return space when pool is filled with once large file and
            once with small files.

        Use cases:
            Create a pool.
            Create a POSIX container.
            Mount dfuse.
            Write to a large file until the pool is out of space.
            Remove the file and wait for aggregation to reclaim the space.
            Disable aggregation.
            Create small files until the pool is out of space.
            Enable aggregation.
            Remove the files and wait for aggregation to reclaim the space.
            Disable aggregation.
            Create small files until the pool is out of space.
            Verify the same number of files were written.
