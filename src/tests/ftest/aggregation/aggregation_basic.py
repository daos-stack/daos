        Test Description:
            Purpose of this test is to run ior using DFS api to write to
            the DAOS and rerun it again with the same file option and
            enable the aggregation and verify the aggregation reclaims
            the overwritten space.

        Use case:
            Run ior with read, write, CheckWrite, CheckRead
            Run ior with read, write, CheckWrite, CheckRead with same file
            Enable aggregation and wait for 90 seconds to let the files
            old enough to be marked for aggregation.
            Wait for aggregation to complete.
            Check the utilized capacity of the container/pool. It should be
            roughly the same as after the initial run since aggregation has
            reclaimed the overwritten capacity.
