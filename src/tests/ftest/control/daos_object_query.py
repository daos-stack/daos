    """Test Class Description:
    This test partially covers SRS-12-0624.
    daos utility supports all command options except rollback, verify,
    list-keys and dump.

    Write an object with different object classes, query it with daos object
    query, and verify the output.

    Test with the following object classes.
    202: OC_S4, 214: OC_SX, 220: OC_RP_2G1, 221: OC_PR_2G2
    These classes are selected because they're used in other test and generate
    consistent query output. It would be better if we can understand more about
    object classes/layout, the command, and their relationship so that we can
    test with more classes and do better validation. However, due to the time
    constraint, we'll stick with these four classes and the test steps for now.

    From the command output, verify oid, grp_nr, and the list of grp-replica(s)
    groups.
