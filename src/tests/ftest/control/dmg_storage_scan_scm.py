    """Test Class Description:
    This test partially covers the following requirement.
    (TR-1.0.34) admin can use daos_shell to collect information and create yaml
    file by himself. This means that daos_shell allows to list:
    SCM module and NVMe SSDs with NUMA affinity
    network adaptor with NUMA affinity

    This test focuses on the correctness of SCM info obtained by dmg storage
    scan (so that the admin can create a yaml file correctly). First, it
    verifies the SCM Namespaces exist in /dev. Second, it verifies the namespace
    count by comparing against the number of namespace rows obtained with
    --verbose.
