# Each key is a regex path to match.
# The value for each key can either be the direct tags to use
# or a dictionary containing
#  handler: either "direct" or "FtestTagMap" for special handling. Default is "direct"
#  stop_on_match: Whether to stop processing other entries if when a match is found.
#                 For example, if "src/tests/ftest*" matches, we don't want to also process ".*"
#  tags: the tags to use for a match

# Special handling for ftest, defaulting to pr
src/tests/ftest*:
  handler: FtestTagMap
  stop_on_match: True
  tags: pr

# Individual code areas
src/client/dfs/: dfs

# Everything runs pr unless a previous entry was matched with stop_on_match
.*: pr


# Examples for reference only. Each code area needs to be carefully evaluated.
# Any files touch under "src/cart/" should run "cart" tests
# src/cart/: cart

# Run "control" for files under "src/control/"
# Run "control" and "security" for files under "src/control/security"
# src/control/: control
# src/control/security/: security

# Use ".*" for wildcard match
# src/tests/suite/daos.*: daos_test
