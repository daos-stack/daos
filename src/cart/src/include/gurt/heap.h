 * Binary heap
 *
 * The binary heap is a scalable data structure created using a binary tree. It
 * is capable of maintaining large sets of objects sorted usually by one or
 * more object properties. User is required to register a comparison callback
 * to determine the relevant ordering of any two objects belong to the set.
 *
 * There is no traverse operation, rather the intention is for the object of the
 * lowest priority which will always be at the root of the tree (as this is an
 * implementation of a min-heap) to be removed by users for consumption.
 *
 * Users of the heap should embed a d_binheap_node_t object instance on every
 * object of the set that they wish the binary heap instance to handle, and
 * required to provide a d_binheap_ops::hop_compare() implementation which
 * is used by the heap as the binary predicate during its internal sorting.
 *
 * The implementation provides an optional internal lock supporting, user can
 * select to use its own external lock mechanism as well.
