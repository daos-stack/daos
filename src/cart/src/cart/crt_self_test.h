/*
 * List of supported self-test strategies:
 *
 * SEND:  EMPTY, IOV, BULK_GET
 * REPLY: EMPTY, IOV, BULK_PUT
 *
 * All 9 combinations of the above are supported. Using 7 unique opcodes.
 *
 * Here's a table:
 *
 * SEND:     REPLY:    OPCODE:
 * EMPTY     EMPTY     CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_EMPTY
 * EMPTY     IOV       CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_ID_REPLY_IOV
 * EMPTY     BULK_PUT  CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_BULK
 * EMPTY     BULK_GET  <invalid>
 * IOV       EMPTY     CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_IOV_REPLY_EMPTY
 * IOV       IOV       CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_IOV
 * IOV       BULK_PUT  CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_IOV_REPLY_BULK
 * IOV       BULK_GET  <invalid>
 * BULK_GET  EMPTY     CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_BULK
 * BULK_GET  IOV       CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_BULK_REPLY_IOV
 * BULK_GET  BULK_PUT  CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_BULK
 * BULK_GET  BULK_GET  <invalid>
 * BULK_PUT  EMPTY     <invalid>
 * BULK_PUT  IOV       <invalid>
 * BULK_PUT  BULK_PUT  <invalid>
 * BULK_PUT  BULK_GET  <invalid>
 *
 * There are only 7 opcodes because three operations involving bulk all have
 * identical send/reply messages and therefore do not require unique opcodes
 *
 * Note that BULK_GET on the sending side means that the client will init a bulk
 * session and send it to the service which will perform a BULK_GET to transfer
 * the data. Note that sending a BULK_PUT is not supported because this would
 * require an extra RPC - the service would first have to init its own buffer
 * before instructing the client to perform a BULK_PUT.
 *
 * Similarly, BULK_PUT on the reply side means that the service will perform a
 * BULK_PUT before replying to the test RPC. A BULK_GET is not supported for
 * replies because, again, an extra RPC would be needed to instruct the service
 * to clean up the bulk session at the end of the transfer.
 *
 *
 * The following data structures are used for the various possible RPCs:
 * SEND:
 *    <empty>                                  (NULL)
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_EMPTY
 *    session_id only                          (int32_t)
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_ID_REPLY_IOV
 *    session_id, iov                          (int32_t, d_iov_t)
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_IOV_REPLY_EMPTY
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_IOV
 *    session_id, iov, bulk handle             (int32_t, d_iov_t, crt_bulk_t)
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_IOV_REPLY_BULK
 *    session_id, bulk handle                  (int32_t, crt_bulk_t)
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_BULK_REPLY_IOV
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_BULK
 *
 * REPLY:
 *    <empty>                                  (NULL)
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_EMPTY
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_IOV_REPLY_EMPTY
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_SEND_IOV_REPLY_BULK
 *        CRT_OPC_SELF_TEST_BOTH_BULK
 *    iov                                      (d_iov_t)

/*
 * An overview of self-test sessions:
 *
 * Primary role of sessions:
 * - Memory pre-allocated by open and cleaned up by close (no allocations
 *   during the actual test).
 * - In the future, the amount of information passed to self-test can grow
 *   without changing the size of the test RPCs (which instead only require a
 *   session id to convey all that same information)
 * - Provide long-lived bulk handles to re-use across multiple test messages,
 *   reducing their overhead
 *
 * Opening a session before starting a test is required for all messages except
 * those that are completely empty (send and reply size = 0)
 *
 * When a session is opened, a pool of buffers is allocated (with the number of
 * buffers specified by the caller of open). These buffers are then placed in
 * a stack (aka first-in-last-out queue) for that session. When a new test RPC
 * request is received, a free buffer is popped off the stack and used to
 * service that request. After the response is sent, the buffer is re-added at
 * the front of the stack. This keeps a few buffers constantly in use and some
 * completely idle, which increases the likelihood that buffers will already be
 * in cache. Each session has a lock to protect the stack from concurrent
 * modification.
 *
 * Corner cases that have to be handled:
 * - Open session / close session can be called while RPCs are processing
 *   - This implementation uses read-write locks. Many parallel test messages
 *     can grab as many read locks as needed to satisfy the incoming requests.
 *     When an open or close is called, a write lock is placed over the list of
 *     sessions which excludes all the readers temporarily.
 *   - In the event of open - business returns to normal for ongoing test RPCs
 *   - In the event of close - the ongoing RPCs are no longer able to locate
 *     the requested session ID and will fail gracefully
 *
 * - Minimal buffer / lock contention for multiple threads working on RPCs
 *   - No memory allocation / recollection is performed while holding a lock
 *   - Write locks that disrupt all test messages are only required briefly
 *     while adding or removing a session
 *   - Spinlocks are used to take/return available buffers from the per-session
 *     stack
