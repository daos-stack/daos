# Algorithmic Object Placement Unit Tests

This folder contains unit test utilities for DAOS's algorithmic object placement options.

These binaries are generated from this folder:
- `bin/ring_pl_test` - A unit test for `PL_TYPE_RING` placement. No command line arguments.
- `bin/jump_pl_test` - A unit test for `PL_TYPE_JUMP_MAP` placement. No command line arguments.
- `bin/pl_bench` - A tool to measure placement performance. Many different command-line arguments control cluster topology and what is measured.
